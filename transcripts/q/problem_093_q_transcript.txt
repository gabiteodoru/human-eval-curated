Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/93
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def encode(message):
    """
    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
    vowel in the english alphabet. 
    Assume only letters. 
    
    Examples:
    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')
    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: encode

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_93.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the requirements:

1. Swap case of all letters
2. Replace vowels with the letter 2 places ahead in the alphabet
3. Assume only letters (but the example shows spaces are preserved)

    / A -> C, E -> G, I -> K, O -> Q, U -> W
    
    / Test with the examples

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:06:37 ---
Great! Let me test with the second example:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:06:37 ---
  command:
    encode["This is a message"]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 10:06:37 ---
String("tHKS KS C MGSSCGG")

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:06:40 ---
Perfect! Both test cases pass. However, let me refactor this to be more idiomatic q with better vectorization:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:06:42 ---
  command:
    / More idiomatic version using vectorized operations
    encode: {[message]
      vowelMap: "aeiouAEIOU"!"cgkqwCGKQW";
      / First swap case
      swapped: {$[x within ("A";"Z"); lower x; x within ("a";"z"); upper x; x]} each message;
      / Then replace vowels
      {$[x in key vowelMap; vowelMap[x]; x]} each swapped
     };
    encode["test"]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 10:06:42 ---

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:06:45 ---
  command:
    encode["This is a message"]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 10:06:45 ---

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:06:47 ---
Excellent! Both test cases pass. Let me run a few more tests to ensure robustness:

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:06:48 ---
  command:
    / Test edge cases
    encode[""];
    encode["AEIOU"];
    encode["aeiou"];
    encode["bcdfg"]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 10:06:48 ---
String("BCDFG")

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:06:51 ---
  command:
    encode["AEIOU"]

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 10:06:51 ---
String("cgkqw")

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:06:53 ---
  command:
    encode["aeiou"]

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 10:06:53 ---

--- 28. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:06:56 ---
Perfect! All tests pass. Now let me write the solution to a file:

--- 29. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 10:06:59 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_93_q_session_a6c5c2c7/problem_solution_93.q
  content:
    encode: {[message]
      vowelMap: "aeiouAEIOU"!"cgkqwCGKQW";
      / First swap case
      swapped: {$[x within ("A";"Z"); lower x; x within ("a";"z"); upper x; x]} each message;
      / Then replace vowels
      {$[x in key vowelMap; vowelMap[x]; x]} each swapped
     }
    

--- 30. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:07:04 ---
Solution complete! The `encode` function:

1. **Swaps case** of all letters (uppercase→lowercase, lowercase→uppercase)
2. **Replaces vowels** with letters 2 places ahead (a→c, e→g, i→k, o→q, u→w)
3. **Preserves non-letters** (like spaces)

The implementation uses idiomatic q with vectorized operations via `each` and conditional logic with `$[...]`.
