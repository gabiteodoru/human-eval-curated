Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/69
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: search

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_69.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:45:42 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:45:46 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- Find the greatest integer where its frequency >= the integer value itself
- Return -1 if no such value exists

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:45:47 ---
  command:
    / First, let's understand group function - it groups indices by value
    lst: 4 1 2 2 3 1;
    group lst

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:45:47 ---

    freqs: count each group lst;
    freqs

  command:
    / Get keys (values) and values (frequencies) from the dictionary
    lst: 4 1 2 2 3 1;
    freqs: count each group lst;
    vals: key freqs;
    counts: value freqs;
    (vals;counts)

List_Untyped([List_Int64([4, 1, 2, 3]), List_Int64([1, 2, 2, 1])])

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:45:57 ---
  command:
    / Filter where frequency >= value, then get max
    lst: 4 1 2 2 3 1;
    freqs: count each group lst;
    vals: key freqs;
    counts: value freqs;

  command:
    / Get the maximum or -1 if empty
    lst: 4 1 2 2 3 1;
    freqs: count each group lst;
    vals: key freqs;
    counts: value freqs;
    valid: vals where counts >= vals;
    $[count valid; max valid; -1]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 23:46:01 ---
2

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:46:04 ---
Perfect! Now let me create the function and test it with all examples:

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:46:05 ---
  command:
    search: {[lst]
      freqs: count each group lst;
      vals: key freqs;
      counts: value freqs;
      valid: vals where counts >= vals;
      $[count valid; max valid; -1]
      };

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:46:05 ---
None

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:46:05 ---
  command:
    / Test example 1: should return 2
    search[4 1 2 2 3 1]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 23:46:05 ---
2

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:46:09 ---
  command:
    / Test example 2: should return 3
    search[1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 23:46:10 ---
3

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:46:13 ---
  command:
    / Test example 3: should return -1
    search[5 5 4 4 4]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 23:46:13 ---
-1

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:46:17 ---
  command:
    / Let's verify the logic for example 3
    / 5 appears 2 times (2 < 5, so not valid)
    / 4 appears 3 times (3 < 4, so not valid)
    freqs: count each group 5 5 4 4 4;
    freqs

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 23:46:17 ---
{[Int64->Int64] 5: 2, 4: 3}

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:46:21 ---
Excellent! All tests pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 27. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:46:23 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_69_q_session_096461f7/problem_solution_69.q
  content:
    search: {[lst]
      freqs: count each group lst;
      vals: key freqs;
      counts: value freqs;
      valid: vals where counts >= vals;
      $[count valid; max valid; -1]
      }
    

--- 28. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:46:28 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_69.q`.

The implementation:
- Uses `group` to create a dictionary mapping each value to its indices
- Uses `count each` to count frequencies
- Extracts keys (values) and values (frequencies) from the dictionary
- Filters values where frequency >= value itself
- Returns the maximum valid value, or -1 if none exist

All test cases pass:
- `search[4 1 2 2 3 1]` → 2
- `search[1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4]` → 3
- `search[5 5 4 4 4]` → -1
