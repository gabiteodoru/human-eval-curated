Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/47
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def median(l: list):
    """Return median of elements in the list l.
    >>> median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
    3
    >>> median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])
    15.0
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: median

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_47.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

Now let me develop the median function. The median is the middle value when the list is sorted. If the list has an odd number of elements, it's the middle element. If even, it's the average of the two middle elements.

Now let me test it with the provided examples:

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:25:59 ---
I see there's an issue with my median calculation for even-length lists. Let me fix this:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:25:59 ---
  command:
    median: {s:asc x; n:count s; $[n mod 2; s[n div 2]; avg s[(n div 2)-1 0]]};

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 23:25:58 ---
8.0

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:26:01 ---
Good! Let me verify with the sorted list to check the logic:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:02 ---
  command:
    asc -10 4 6 1000 10 20

List_Int64([-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000])

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:05 ---
  command:
    avg 6 10

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 23:26:05 ---
8.0

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:26:08 ---
Wait, the expected output is 15.0, but I'm getting 8.0. Let me check which elements should be in the middle:

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:09 ---
  command:
    s:asc -10 4 6 1000 10 20; n:count s; (n div 2)-1 0

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 23:26:10 ---
List_Int64([2, 3])

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:13 ---
  command:
    s:asc -10 4 6 1000 10 20; s[2 3]

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 23:26:13 ---
List_Int64([6, 10])

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:26:16 ---
I see the issue - the expected answer is 15.0, which is the average of 10 and 20. Let me re-examine the sorted list and the correct indices:

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:17 ---
  command:
    avg 10 20

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 23:26:17 ---
15.0

--- 30. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:20 ---
  command:
    s:asc -10 4 6 1000 10 20; n:count s; n

--- 31. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #30) at 23:26:21 ---

--- 32. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:23 ---
  command:
    s:asc -10 4 6 1000 10 20; n:count s; (n div 2)-1; n div 2

--- 33. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #32) at 23:26:23 ---

--- 34. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:26 ---
  command:
    s:asc -10 4 6 1000 10 20; s[3 4]

--- 35. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #34) at 23:26:26 ---
List_Int64([10, 20])

--- 36. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:26:28 ---
Perfect! So for n=6, I need indices 2 and 3 (0-indexed), but I was getting the wrong indices. The issue is in my calculation. Let me fix it:

--- 37. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:30 ---
  command:
    median: {s:asc x; n:count s; $[n mod 2; s[n div 2]; avg s[-1 0+n div 2]]};

--- 38. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #37) at 23:26:30 ---
None

--- 39. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:33 ---
  command:
    median[-10 4 6 1000 10 20]

--- 40. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #39) at 23:26:33 ---
8.0

--- 41. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:37 ---
  command:
    s:asc -10 4 6 1000 10 20; n:count s; -1 0+n div 2

--- 42. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #41) at 23:26:37 ---
List_Int64([2, 3])

--- 43. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:26:42 ---
I'm still getting indices 2 and 3. But I need 3 and 4. Let me reconsider: for a list of 6 elements (indices 0-5), the two middle elements are at indices 2 and 3 (elements 3 and 4 when counting from 1). But the sorted list is `[-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000]`, so indices 2 and 3 give us 6 and 10, not 10 and 20.

Wait, let me check if there's something wrong with the expected output:

--- 44. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:43 ---
  command:
    asc -10 4 6 1000 10 20

--- 45. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #44) at 23:26:43 ---
List_Int64([-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000])

--- 46. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:26:48 ---
The median of `[-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000]` should be the average of the two middle elements (indices 2 and 3), which are 6 and 10, giving 8.0. But the expected output is 15.0. Let me check if Python's median behaves differently:

--- 47. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:48 ---
  command:
    med(asc -10 4 6 1000 10 20)

--- 48. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #47) at 23:26:48 ---
8.0

--- 49. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:26:53 ---
Even q's built-in `med` function returns 8.0. Let me re-read the Python example more carefully. Perhaps the expected output in the problem statement is wrong, or I should use q's built-in median function. Let me test my current solution with the first example:

--- 50. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:26:54 ---
  command:
    median[3 1 2 4 5]

--- 51. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #50) at 23:26:54 ---
3

--- 52. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:26:58 ---
The first example works correctly. My implementation follows the standard definition of median. Let me write the solution to the file:

--- 53. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:26:58 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_47_q_session_352430e4/problem_solution_47.q
  content:
    median: {s:asc x; n:count s; $[n mod 2; s[n div 2]; avg s[-1 0+n div 2]]}
    

--- 54. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:27:03 ---
Solution complete! The `median` function:
- Sorts the input list using `asc`
- Calculates count `n`
- For odd-length lists: returns middle element at index `n div 2`
- For even-length lists: returns average of two middle elements at indices `(n div 2)-1` and `n div 2`
