Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/159
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    Variables:
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the additional number of carrots you must eat to complete the day's meals
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
    
    Constrain:
    * 0 <= number <= 1000
    * 0 <= need <= 1000
    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000

    Have fun :)

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: eat

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_159.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:45:49 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:45:53 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- The rabbit has already eaten `number` carrots
- The rabbit needs to eat `need` more carrots
- There are `remaining` carrots available
- Return: [total eaten, carrots left]
- If not enough carrots, eat all available

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:45:54 ---
  command:
    eat: {[number; need; remaining]
      actualEaten: need & remaining;
      (number + actualEaten; remaining - actualEaten)
     };

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:45:54 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:45:56 ---
Now let me test with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:45:57 ---
  command:
    eat[5; 6; 10]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 07:45:57 ---
List_Int64([11, 4])

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:45:59 ---
  command:
    eat[4; 8; 9]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 07:45:59 ---
List_Int64([12, 1])

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:46:02 ---
  command:
    eat[1; 10; 10]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 07:46:02 ---
List_Int64([11, 0])

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:46:04 ---
  command:
    eat[2; 11; 5]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 07:46:05 ---
List_Int64([7, 0])

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:46:08 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 17. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:46:10 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_159_q_session_9f874303/problem_solution_159.q
  content:
    eat: {[number; need; remaining]
      actualEaten: need & remaining;
      (number + actualEaten; remaining - actualEaten)
     }
    

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:46:14 ---
Done! The solution uses q's minimum operator `&` to calculate how many carrots can actually be eaten (the minimum of what's needed and what's available), then returns the total eaten and remaining carrots.
