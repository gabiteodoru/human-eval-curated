Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/125
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def split_words(txt):
    '''
    Given a string of words, return a list of words split on whitespace, if no whitespaces exists in the text you
    should split on commas ',' if no commas exists you should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the
    alphabet, ord('a') = 0, ord('b') = 1, ... ord('z') = 25
    Examples
    split_words("Hello world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
    split_words("Hello,world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
    split_words("abcdef") == 3 
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: split_words

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_125.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 08:16:04 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:16:08 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
1. Split on whitespace if whitespace exists
2. Otherwise, split on commas if commas exist
3. Otherwise, return count of lowercase letters with odd alphabet position (a=0, b=1, c=2, etc.)

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 45. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:17:09 ---
Excellent! The function works correctly. Now let me write it to the solution file:

--- 46. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:17:14 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_125_q_session_d2330afe/problem_solution_125.q
  content:
    split_words: {[txt]
      $[" " in txt;
        " " vs txt;
        "," in txt;
        "," vs txt;
        / Count lowercase letters with odd positions
        sum ((txt >= "a") & (txt <= "z")) & 1 = (("i"$txt) - "i"$"a") mod 2
      ]
     };
    

--- 47. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:17:19 ---
Done! The solution implements the `split_words` function in idiomatic q/kdb+:

- Uses conditional `$[...]` to check conditions in order
- First checks for whitespace and splits with `" " vs txt`
- Then checks for commas and splits with `"," vs txt`
- Otherwise counts lowercase letters with odd alphabet positions by:
  - Converting chars to integers and subtracting ASCII 'a' to get 0-based positions
  - Checking if position is odd with `mod 2`
  - Filtering for lowercase letters only
  - Summing the count

The function correctly handles all test cases from the problem specification.
