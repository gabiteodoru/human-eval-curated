Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/33
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: sort_third

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_33.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:10:25 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:10:29 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- We need to sort elements at indices divisible by 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, ...)
- Keep other elements in their original positions
- Return a new list with sorted values at divisible-by-3 indices

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:10:30 ---
  command:
    / First, let's understand the examples
    l1: 1 2 3;
    l2: 5 6 3 4 8 9 2;
    
    / Find indices divisible by 3
    til count l2

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:10:30 ---
List_Int64([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:10:34 ---
  command:
    / Indices divisible by 3
    idx: where 0 = (til count l2) mod 3;
    idx

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:10:34 ---
List_Int64([0, 3, 6])

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:10:37 ---
  command:
    / Get values at those indices
    vals: l2[idx];
    vals

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 23:10:37 ---
List_Int64([5, 4, 2])

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:10:41 ---
  command:
    / Sort those values
    sorted_vals: asc vals;
    sorted_vals

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 23:10:41 ---
List_Int64([2, 4, 5])

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:10:44 ---
  command:
    / Now replace those values back in the original list
    result: @[l2; idx; :; sorted_vals];
    result

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 23:10:45 ---
List_Int64([2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5])

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:10:47 ---
Perfect! Now let me create the complete function:

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:10:46 ---
  command:
    sort_third: {[l]
      idx: where 0 = (til count l) mod 3;
      @[l; idx; :; asc l[idx]]
     };
    sort_third[1 2 3]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:10:46 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 3])

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:10:49 ---
  command:
    sort_third[5 6 3 4 8 9 2]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 23:10:49 ---
List_Int64([2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5])

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:10:52 ---
Excellent! Both test cases pass. Let me test a few edge cases:

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:10:53 ---
  command:
    / Empty list
    sort_third[`long$()];
    / Single element
    sort_third[enlist 5];
    / Two elements
    sort_third[10 20]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 23:10:53 ---
List_Int64([10, 20])

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:10:56 ---
  command:
    / Longer list to verify
    sort_third[9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 23:10:56 ---
List_Int64([0, 8, 7, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2, 1, 9])

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:11:02 ---
  command:
    / Verify: indices 0,3,6,9 have values 9,6,3,0 originally
    / After sorting: 0,3,6,9 should be at those positions
    l: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0;
    idx: where 0 = (til count l) mod 3;
    idx

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 23:11:02 ---
List_Int64([0, 3, 6, 9])

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:11:06 ---
  command:
    / Original values at those indices
    l[idx]

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 23:11:06 ---
List_Int64([9, 6, 3, 0])

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:11:09 ---
  command:
    / Sorted values
    asc l[idx]

--- 30. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #29) at 23:11:09 ---
List_Int64([0, 3, 6, 9])

--- 31. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:11:13 ---
  command:
    / Result should have 0,3,6,9 at positions 0,3,6,9
    result: sort_third[9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0];
    result[idx]

--- 32. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #31) at 23:11:13 ---
List_Int64([0, 3, 6, 9])

--- 33. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:11:16 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 34. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:11:17 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_33_q_session_e616b1f6/problem_solution_33.q
  content:
    sort_third: {[l]
      idx: where 0 = (til count l) mod 3;
      @[l; idx; :; asc l[idx]]
     }
    

--- 35. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:11:22 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_33.q`.

The implementation:
- Uses `til count l mod 3` to find indices divisible by 3
- Extracts values at those indices with `l[idx]`
- Sorts them with `asc`
- Uses the `@` amend operator to replace values at the specified indices
- Returns the modified list
