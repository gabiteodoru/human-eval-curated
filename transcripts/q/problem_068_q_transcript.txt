Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/68
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def pluck(arr):
    """
    "Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []
    
    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000
        * 0 <= node.value

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: pluck

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_68.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this step by step, connecting to the q server and developing a solution.

Now let me develop and test the solution:

  command:
    / Find the smallest even value and its first index
    pluck: {[arr]
      if[0=count arr; :()];
      evens: where 0=arr mod 2;
      if[0=count evens; :()];
      vals: arr[evens];
      minVal: min vals;
      idx: first evens where vals=minVal;
      (minVal;idx)
     };

    / Test single even element
    pluck[enlist 8]

Excellent! All tests pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 23. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:45:28 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_68_q_session_158e499b/problem_solution_68.q
  content:
    pluck: {[arr]
      if[0=count arr; :()];
      evens: where 0=arr mod 2;
      if[0=count evens; :()];
      vals: arr[evens];
      minVal: min vals;
      idx: first evens where vals=minVal;
      (minVal;idx)
     }
    

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:45:33 ---
Solution complete! The `pluck` function:

1. Returns empty list if input array is empty
2. Finds indices of all even values using `where 0=arr mod 2`
3. Returns empty list if no even values exist
4. Finds the minimum even value
5. Returns the first occurrence of that minimum value with its index as a 2-element list

The solution leverages q's vectorized operations (`mod`, `where`, `min`) for efficient, idiomatic code.
