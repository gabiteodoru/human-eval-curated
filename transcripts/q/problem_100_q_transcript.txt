Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/100
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: make_a_pile

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_100.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:54:53 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:54:59 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- Given n levels, first level has n stones
- If n is odd, each subsequent level adds 2 (next odd numbers: n, n+2, n+4, ...)
- If n is even, each subsequent level adds 2 (next even numbers: n, n+2, n+4, ...)
- So regardless of odd/even, we're creating an arithmetic sequence starting at n with step 2

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:54:59 ---
  command:
    make_a_pile: {n + 2 * til x};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:54:59 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:55:02 ---
  command:
    make_a_pile[3]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 07:55:02 ---
Error: n
Trace:
  [4]  make_a_pile:{n + 2 * til x}
                    ^
  [3]  make_a_pile[3]
       ^


--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:55:05 ---
I need to fix the variable name. Let me use `x` as the parameter:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:55:05 ---
  command:
    make_a_pile: {x + 2 * til x};

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 07:55:05 ---
None

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:55:08 ---
  command:
    make_a_pile[3]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 07:55:08 ---
List_Int64([3, 5, 7])

--- 14. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:55:11 ---
Perfect! Let me test with more cases to verify:

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:55:12 ---
  command:
    make_a_pile[4]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 07:55:12 ---
List_Int64([4, 6, 8, 10])

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:55:14 ---
  command:
    make_a_pile[1]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 07:55:14 ---
List_Int64([1])

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:55:16 ---
  command:
    make_a_pile[5]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 07:55:16 ---
List_Int64([5, 7, 9, 11, 13])

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:55:19 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 22. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:55:21 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_100_q_session_eb3de7a9/problem_solution_100.q
  content:
    make_a_pile: {x + 2 * til x}
    

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:55:25 ---
Done! The solution is complete and saved to `problem_solution_100.q`.

The implementation uses a simple vectorized approach:
- `til x` generates indices [0, 1, 2, ..., x-1]
- `2 * til x` creates the increments [0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(x-1)]
- `x + 2 * til x` produces the final sequence starting at x with step 2

This works for both odd and even values of n since both cases follow the same arithmetic progression pattern.
