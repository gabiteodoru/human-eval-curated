Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/11
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List


def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
    >>> string_xor('010', '110')
    '100'
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: string_xor

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_11.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 22:48:32 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:48:35 ---
Now let me develop and test the `string_xor` function. The idea is to:
1. Convert the string characters to integers
2. Perform XOR operation on each pair
3. Convert back to string

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:48:37 ---
  command:
    string_xor: {[a;b] {string x} each (("J"$a) <> ("J"$b))};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:48:37 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:48:40 ---
  command:
    string_xor["010";"110"];

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 22:48:40 ---
None

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:48:40 ---
Let me check what the result looks like:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:48:40 ---
  command:
    show string_xor["010";"110"];

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 22:48:40 ---
None

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:48:43 ---
Let me check the output more carefully:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:48:44 ---
  command:
    res: string_xor["010";"110"]; res;

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 22:48:44 ---
None

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:48:46 ---
Let me try a different approach - I need to see what's being returned:

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:48:47 ---
  command:
    ("J"$"010") <> ("J"$"110");

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 22:48:47 ---
None

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:48:50 ---
Let me get the console view to see the actual output:

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__get_last_query_result_q_view (Message #1) at 22:48:50 ---
  (no parameters)

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:48:53 ---
Let me try using console_output_only:

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:48:53 ---
  command:
    show ("J"$"010") <> ("J"$"110");
  console_output_only: True

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 22:48:54 ---
None

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:48:57 ---
Let me check the q view:

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__get_last_query_result_q_view (Message #1) at 22:48:57 ---
  (no parameters)

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:49:00 ---
Let me try a simpler test:

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:49:00 ---
  command:
    "J"$"010";
  console_output_only: True

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 22:49:00 ---
None

--- 28. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:49:02 ---
Let me try a different approach - working with individual characters:

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:49:03 ---
  command:
    "010";
  console_output_only: True

--- 30. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #29) at 22:49:03 ---
None

--- 31. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__get_last_query_result_q_view (Message #1) at 22:49:06 ---
  (no parameters)

--- 32. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:49:09 ---
Let me try without console_output_only and check the raw result:

--- 33. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:49:09 ---
  command:
    a:"010"; b:"110"; a

--- 34. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #33) at 22:49:09 ---
String("010")

--- 35. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:49:10 ---
Good! Now let me work on the XOR logic. In q, I need to:
1. Convert each character to integer
2. Apply XOR
3. Convert back to string

--- 36. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:49:11 ---
  command:
    "J"$'a

--- 37. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #36) at 22:49:11 ---
List_Int64([0, 1, 0])

--- 38. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:49:13 ---
Great! Now let me apply XOR:

--- 39. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:49:14 ---
  command:
    ("J"$'a) <> ("J"$'b)

--- 40. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #39) at 22:49:14 ---
List_Bool([True, False, False])

--- 41. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:49:17 ---
Perfect! XOR works. Now I need to convert booleans back to "0" and "1" strings:

--- 42. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:49:17 ---
  command:
    string ("J"$'a) <> ("J"$'b)

--- 43. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #42) at 22:49:17 ---
List_Untyped([String("1"), String("0"), String("0")])

--- 44. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:49:20 ---
Good! Now I need to join them into a single string:

--- 45. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:49:21 ---
  command:
    raze string ("J"$'a) <> ("J"$'b)

--- 46. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #45) at 22:49:21 ---
String("100")

--- 47. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:49:24 ---
Perfect! That gives us "100" which matches the expected output. Now let me create the complete function:

--- 48. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:49:25 ---
  command:
    string_xor: {[a;b] raze string ("J"$'a) <> ("J"$'b)};

--- 49. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #48) at 22:49:25 ---
None

--- 50. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:49:29 ---
Now let me test it with the example:

--- 51. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:49:29 ---
  command:
    string_xor["010";"110"]

--- 52. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #51) at 22:49:29 ---
String("100")

--- 53. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:49:32 ---
Excellent! Let me test with a few more cases:

--- 54. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:49:32 ---
  command:
    string_xor["1";"1"]

--- 55. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #54) at 22:49:33 ---
String("0")

--- 56. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:49:36 ---
  command:
    string_xor["0";"0"]

--- 57. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #56) at 22:49:36 ---
String("0")

--- 58. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:49:39 ---
  command:
    string_xor["1";"0"]

--- 59. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #58) at 22:49:39 ---
String("1")

--- 60. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:49:39 ---
  command:
    string_xor["0";"1"]

--- 61. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #60) at 22:49:39 ---
String("1")

--- 62. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:49:42 ---
Perfect! All XOR truth table cases work correctly. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 63. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:49:44 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_11_q_session_2aa221b3/problem_solution_11.q
  content:
    string_xor: {[a;b] raze string ("J"$'a) <> ("J"$'b)};
    

--- 64. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:49:50 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_11.q`. 

The function uses idiomatic q:
- `"J"$'` converts each character to integer (vectorized with `'`)
- `<>` is the XOR operator
- `string` converts booleans to "0"/"1" strings
- `raze` concatenates the list into a single string
