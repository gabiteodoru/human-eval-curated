Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/115
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    """
    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
    and all buckets have the same capacity.
    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.

    Example 1:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 1
        Output: 6

    Example 2:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 2
        Output: 5
    
    Example 3:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
            bucket_capacity : 5
        Output: 0

    Constraints:
        * all wells have the same length
        * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
        * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2
        * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1
        * 1 <= capacity <= 10

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: max_fill

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_115.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 09:46:05 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:46:09 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- Each row in the grid represents a well
- Each 1 represents a unit of water
- We need to count how many times we lower buckets to empty all wells
- For each well, we need `ceiling(water_units / capacity)` bucket lowers

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:46:10 ---
  command:
    / Test the concept: count 1s in each row and divide by capacity
    grid1: (0 0 1 0; 0 1 0 0; 1 1 1 1);
    grid1

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 09:46:11 ---
List_Untyped([List_Int64([0, 0, 1, 0]), List_Int64([0, 1, 0, 0]), List_Int64([1, 1, 1, 1])])

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:46:14 ---
  command:
    / Sum each row to get water units per well
    sum each grid1

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 09:46:14 ---

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:46:16 ---
  command:
    / Calculate ceiling division for capacity=1
    capacity: 1;
    waterUnits: sum each grid1;
    ceiling waterUnits % capacity

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 09:46:16 ---

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:46:20 ---
  command:
    / Sum to get total bucket lowers
    sum ceiling waterUnits % capacity

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 09:46:20 ---

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:46:23 ---
Perfect! Now let me create the complete function and test it with all examples:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:46:24 ---
  command:
    / Define the max_fill function
    max_fill: {[grid; capacity]
      sum ceiling (sum each grid) % capacity
      };

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 09:46:24 ---
None

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:46:27 ---
  command:
    / Test Example 1
    grid1: (0 0 1 0; 0 1 0 0; 1 1 1 1);
    max_fill[grid1; 1]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 09:46:27 ---
6

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:46:30 ---
  command:
    / Test Example 2
    grid2: (0 0 1 1; 0 0 0 0; 1 1 1 1; 0 1 1 1);
    max_fill[grid2; 2]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 09:46:30 ---

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:46:33 ---
  command:
    / Test Example 3
    grid3: (0 0 0; 0 0 0);
    max_fill[grid3; 5]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 09:46:33 ---
0

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:46:37 ---
Excellent! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 23. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 09:46:38 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_115_q_session_d9a7d706/problem_solution_115.q
  content:
    max_fill: {[grid; capacity]
      sum ceiling (sum each grid) % capacity
      }
    

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:46:44 ---
Perfect! I've successfully implemented the `max_fill` function in native q/kdb+.

**Solution Summary:**

The function uses idiomatic q with vectorized operations:
- `sum each grid` - sums each row to get water units per well
- `% capacity` - divides by bucket capacity
- `ceiling` - rounds up to get required bucket lowers per well
- `sum` - totals all bucket lowers

All three test cases pass:
- Example 1: grid with [1,1,4] water units, capacity 1 → 6 bucket lowers ✓
- Example 2: grid with [2,0,4,3] water units, capacity 2 → 5 bucket lowers ✓
- Example 3: grid with [0,0] water units, capacity 5 → 0 bucket lowers ✓
