Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/4
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: mean_absolute_deviation

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_4.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

Now let me understand the problem and develop the solution:
- Calculate the mean of the input numbers
- Calculate the absolute difference between each element and the mean
- Return the average of these absolute differences

    mean_absolute_deviation: {[numbers] avg abs numbers - avg numbers};

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 25. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:44:49 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_4_q_session_f7906075/problem_solution_4.q
  content:
    mean_absolute_deviation: {[numbers] avg abs numbers - avg numbers};
    

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:44:54 ---
Done! I've created a concise q/kdb+ solution that:

1. **Calculates the mean**: `avg numbers`
2. **Computes absolute deviations**: `abs numbers - avg numbers` (vectorized operation)
3. **Returns the average**: `avg` of the absolute deviations

The solution leverages q's strengths:
- Fully vectorized (no loops)
- Uses built-in functions (`avg`, `abs`)
- Single line implementation
- Handles all test cases correctly
