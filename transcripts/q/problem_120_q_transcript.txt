Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/120
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def maximum(arr, k):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

    Example 1:

        Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
        Output: [-4, -3, 5]

    Example 2:

        Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
        Output: [4, 4]

    Example 3:

        Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
        Output: [2]

    Note:
        1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
        2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
        3. 0 <= k <= len(arr)
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: maximum

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_120.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 08:13:25 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:13:28 ---
Now let's develop the solution. The task is to find the maximum k numbers from an array and return them sorted.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:13:31 ---
  command:
    / First, let's understand the approach: take k largest elements and sort them
    / Test with example 1: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
    arr: -3 -4 5;
    k: 3;
    / Sort descending, take first k elements, then sort ascending
    asc k#desc arr

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 08:13:31 ---
List_Int64([-4, -3, 5])

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:13:32 ---
Great! Let's test with the other examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:13:34 ---
  command:
    / Example 2: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
    arr: 4 -4 4;
    k: 2;
    asc k#desc arr

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 08:13:34 ---
List_Int64([4, 4])

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:13:38 ---
  command:
    / Example 3: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
    arr: -3 2 1 2 -1 -2 1;
    k: 1;
    asc k#desc arr

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 08:13:38 ---
List_Int64([2])

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:13:40 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let's create the function:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:13:41 ---
  command:
    / Define the maximum function
    maximum: {[arr;k] asc k#desc arr};
    / Test it
    maximum[-3 -4 5; 3]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 08:13:41 ---
List_Int64([-4, -3, 5])

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:13:44 ---
  command:
    maximum[4 -4 4; 2]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 08:13:44 ---
List_Int64([4, 4])

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:13:46 ---
  command:
    maximum[-3 2 1 2 -1 -2 1; 1]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 08:13:46 ---
List_Int64([2])

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:13:48 ---
Excellent! Let me also test edge cases:

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:13:49 ---
  command:
    / Edge case: k = 0
    maximum[1 2 3; 0]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 08:13:49 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:13:52 ---
  command:
    / Edge case: k equals length of array
    maximum[5 3 1; 3]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 08:13:52 ---
List_Int64([1, 3, 5])

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:13:55 ---
Perfect! Now let's write the solution to the file:

--- 25. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:13:57 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_120_q_session_7062e6c7/problem_solution_120.q
  content:
    maximum: {[arr;k] asc k#desc arr}
    

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:14:01 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_120.q`.

The q implementation is elegant and concise:
- `desc arr` - sort array in descending order
- `k#` - take the first k elements (the k largest)
- `asc` - sort them in ascending order

This leverages q's vectorized operations and built-in sorting functions.
