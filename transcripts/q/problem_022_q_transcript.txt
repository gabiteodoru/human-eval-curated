Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/22
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List, Any


def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """ Filter given list of any python values only for integers
    >>> filter_integers(['a', 3.14, 5])
    [5]
    >>> filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []])
    [1, 2, 3]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: filter_integers

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_22.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

  command:
    / Test case 1: ['a', 3.14, 5] should return [5]

--- 28. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:01:05 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_22_q_session_3f40433b/problem_solution_22.q
  content:
    filter_integers: {[values] values where (type each values) in -7 -6 -5h}
    

--- 29. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:01:11 ---
Perfect! I've successfully solved the HumanEval/22 problem using native q/kdb+.

## Solution Summary

The `filter_integers` function filters a list to keep only integer values using:
- `type each values` - gets the type code of each element
- `in -7 -6 -5h` - checks if type is short (-5h), int (-6h), or long (-7h)
- `values where` - filters the list to keep only matching elements

The solution is idiomatic q, using vectorized operations and leveraging q's type system. It correctly handles all test cases including mixed types, empty lists, and lists with no integers.
