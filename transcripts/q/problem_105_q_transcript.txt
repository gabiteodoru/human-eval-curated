Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/105
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def by_length(arr):
    """
    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,
    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from
    "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine".

    For example:
      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   
            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] 
            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]
      return ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
    
      If the array is empty, return an empty array:
      arr = []
      return []
    
      If the array has any strange number ignore it:
      arr = [1, -1 , 55] 
            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]
            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]
      return = ['One']
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: by_length

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_105.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 08:00:39 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:00:41 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:00:43 ---
  command:
    / Create a mapping from digits to names
    digitNames: `One`Two`Three`Four`Five`Six`Seven`Eight`Nine;
    digitNames

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 08:00:43 ---
List_Untyped(["One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine"])

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:00:47 ---
  command:
    / Define the by_length function
    by_length: {[arr]
      digitNames: `One`Two`Three`Four`Five`Six`Seven`Eight`Nine;
      / Filter numbers between 1 and 9 inclusive
      filtered: arr where (arr >= 1) and (arr <= 9);
      / Sort the filtered array
      sorted: asc filtered;
      / Reverse the sorted array
      reversed: reverse sorted;
      / Map each digit to its name (subtract 1 for 0-based indexing)
      digitNames[reversed - 1]
     };

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 08:00:47 ---
None

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:00:49 ---
Now let me test with the examples from the problem:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:00:50 ---
  command:
    / Test case 1: [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]
    by_length[2 1 1 4 5 8 2 3]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 08:00:51 ---
List_Untyped(["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"])

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:00:53 ---
  command:
    / Test case 2: empty array
    by_length[()]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 08:00:53 ---
List_Untyped([])

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:00:56 ---
  command:
    / Test case 3: array with strange numbers [1, -1, 55]
    by_length[1 -1 55]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 08:00:56 ---
List_Untyped(["One"])

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:00:59 ---
  command:
    / Test with edge cases
    by_length[9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 08:00:59 ---
List_Untyped(["Nine", "Eight", "Seven", "Six", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "One"])

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:01:01 ---
Perfect! The solution is working correctly. Let me write it to the file:

--- 19. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:01:04 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_105_q_session_dcd5707d/problem_solution_105.q
  content:
    by_length: {[arr]
      digitNames: `One`Two`Three`Four`Five`Six`Seven`Eight`Nine;
      filtered: arr where (arr >= 1) and (arr <= 9);
      sorted: asc filtered;
      reversed: reverse sorted;
      digitNames[reversed - 1]
     };
    

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:01:08 ---
Solution complete! The `by_length` function:
1. Filters integers between 1-9 inclusive using vectorized operations
2. Sorts the filtered array with `asc`
3. Reverses the sorted array with `reverse`
4. Maps each digit to its corresponding name using indexed lookup

All test cases pass correctly.
