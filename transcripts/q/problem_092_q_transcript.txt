Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/92
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    
    Examples
    any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False

    any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False
  

    
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: any_int

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_92.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the requirements:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 00:11:08 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:11:11 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
1. Takes 3 numbers (x, y, z)
2. Returns true if ALL are integers AND one equals the sum of the other two
3. Returns false otherwise

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:11:12 ---
  command:
    / Check if a value is an integer
    isInt: {x~floor x};
    isInt each 5 3.6 -2

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 00:11:12 ---
List_Bool([False, False, False])

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:11:16 ---
  command:
    / Check types
    5h = type 5;
    -7h = type `long$5;
    -9h = type 5f

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 00:11:16 ---
True

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:11:20 ---
  command:
    / Better integer check - a number is an integer if it equals its floor
    isInt: {x~floor x};
    isInt 5f

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 00:11:20 ---
False

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:11:23 ---
  command:
    isInt 5.0

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 00:11:23 ---
False

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:11:26 ---
  command:
    / Test integer check with actual integers
    isInt 5

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 00:11:26 ---
True

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:11:29 ---
  command:
    isInt -2

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 00:11:29 ---
True

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:11:31 ---
Good! Now let me create the full solution:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:11:33 ---
  command:
    any_int: {[x;y;z]
      / Check if all three are integers
      allInt: all (x;y;z)~'floor each (x;y;z);
      / Check if one equals sum of other two
      sumCheck: (x=y+z) or (y=x+z) or (z=x+y);
      / Return true only if both conditions met
      allInt and sumCheck
     };

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 00:11:33 ---
None

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:11:33 ---
Now let me test with the provided examples:

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:11:34 ---
  command:
    any_int[5;2;7]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 00:11:34 ---
True

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:11:37 ---
  command:
    any_int[3;2;2]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 00:11:37 ---
False

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:11:39 ---
  command:
    any_int[3;-2;1]

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 00:11:39 ---
True

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:11:42 ---
  command:
    any_int[3.6;-2.2;2]

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 00:11:42 ---
False

--- 29. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:11:45 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me write the solution to a file:

--- 30. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 00:11:48 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_92_q_session_4df7b3a9/problem_solution_92.q
  content:
    any_int: {[x;y;z]
      / Check if all three are integers
      allInt: all (x;y;z)~'floor each (x;y;z);
      / Check if one equals sum of other two
      sumCheck: (x=y+z) or (y=x+z) or (z=x+y);
      / Return true only if both conditions met
      allInt and sumCheck
     };
    

--- 31. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:11:57 ---
Solution complete! The `any_int` function:

1. Checks if all three values are integers by comparing each with its floor value
2. Checks if any one value equals the sum of the other two
3. Returns true only when both conditions are met

All test cases pass:
- `any_int[5;2;7]` → True (5+2=7, all integers)
- `any_int[3;2;2]` → False (3≠4, 2≠5, 2≠5)
- `any_int[3;-2;1]` → True (3+(-2)=1, all integers)
- `any_int[3.6;-2.2;2]` → False (not all integers)
