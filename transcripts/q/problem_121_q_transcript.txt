Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/121
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def solution(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.
    

    Examples
    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12
    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9
    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==>0
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: solution

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_121.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 08:14:13 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:14:16 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- Get odd elements that are in even positions (0-indexed)
- Sum those elements
- Examples show: position 0, 2, 4, etc. are "even positions"

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:14:17 ---
  command:
    / Test understanding: even positions are 0, 2, 4, ...
    lst: 5 8 7 1;
    lst

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 08:14:17 ---
List_Int64([5, 8, 7, 1])

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:14:20 ---
  command:
    / Elements at even positions (0, 2)
    lst: 5 8 7 1;
    idx: til count lst;
    idx

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 08:14:20 ---
List_Int64([0, 1, 2, 3])

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:14:23 ---
  command:
    / Get even positions
    lst: 5 8 7 1;
    idx: til count lst;
    evenIdx: where 0 = idx mod 2;
    evenIdx

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 08:14:23 ---
List_Int64([0, 2])

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:14:26 ---
  command:
    / Elements at even positions
    lst: 5 8 7 1;
    evenIdx: where 0 = (til count lst) mod 2;
    lst[evenIdx]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 08:14:26 ---
List_Int64([5, 7])

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:14:30 ---
  command:
    / Filter for odd values
    lst: 5 8 7 1;
    evenIdx: where 0 = (til count lst) mod 2;
    evenPosElements: lst[evenIdx];
    oddElements: evenPosElements where 1 = evenPosElements mod 2;
    oddElements

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 08:14:30 ---
List_Int64([5, 7])

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:14:33 ---
  command:
    / Sum them
    lst: 5 8 7 1;
    evenIdx: where 0 = (til count lst) mod 2;
    evenPosElements: lst[evenIdx];
    oddElements: evenPosElements where 1 = evenPosElements mod 2;
    sum oddElements

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 08:14:33 ---
12

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:14:38 ---
Great! Let me create a more idiomatic, vectorized solution:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:14:40 ---
  command:
    / More idiomatic approach
    solution: {[lst] sum lst where (0 = (til count lst) mod 2) & (1 = lst mod 2)};
    solution[5 8 7 1]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 08:14:40 ---
12

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:14:42 ---
Perfect! Let me test all the examples:

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:14:43 ---
  command:
    solution: {[lst] sum lst where (0 = (til count lst) mod 2) & (1 = lst mod 2)};
    solution[3 3 3 3 3]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 08:14:43 ---
9

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:14:46 ---
  command:
    solution: {[lst] sum lst where (0 = (til count lst) mod 2) & (1 = lst mod 2)};
    solution[30 13 24 321]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 08:14:46 ---
0

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:14:48 ---
Excellent! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 26. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:14:50 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_121_q_session_7812035c/problem_solution_121.q
  content:
    solution: {[lst] sum lst where (0 = (til count lst) mod 2) & (1 = lst mod 2)}
    

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:14:55 ---
Solution complete! The function:
- Uses vectorized operations to identify elements at even positions (indices 0, 2, 4, ...)
- Filters for odd values using modulo
- Sums the result

All test cases pass:
- `solution[5 8 7 1]` → 12 (5+7)
- `solution[3 3 3 3 3]` → 9 (3+3+3)
- `solution[30 13 24 321]` → 0 (no odd elements at even positions)
