Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/58
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.
    >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]

    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: common

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_58.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:36:11 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:36:17 ---
Great! Now let me develop the solution. The problem asks to find sorted unique common elements between two lists.

In q, I can use:
1. `inter` to find intersection of two lists (common elements)
2. `distinct` to get unique elements
3. `asc` to sort in ascending order

Let me test this approach:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:36:15 ---
  command:
    common: {[l1;l2] asc distinct l1 inter l2}

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:36:15 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:36:17 ---
Now let me test with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:36:18 ---
  command:
    common[1 4 3 34 653 2 5; 5 7 1 5 9 653 121]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:36:18 ---
List_Int64([1, 5, 653])

--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:36:21 ---
Perfect! Let me test the second example:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:36:21 ---
  command:
    common[5 3 2 8; 3 2]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 23:36:21 ---
List_Int64([2, 3])

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:36:24 ---
Excellent! Both test cases pass. The solution works correctly.

Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 14. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:36:26 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_58_q_session_963df49d/problem_solution_58.q
  content:
    common: {[l1;l2] asc distinct l1 inter l2}
    

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:36:30 ---
Perfect! The solution is complete. 

The q implementation `common: {[l1;l2] asc distinct l1 inter l2}` leverages q's vectorized operations:
- `inter` finds common elements between the two lists
- `distinct` removes duplicates
- `asc` sorts in ascending order

This is idiomatic q code that efficiently solves the problem in a single line.
