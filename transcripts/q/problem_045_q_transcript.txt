Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/45
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: triangle_area

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_45.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:23:56 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:24:00 ---
Now let me implement and test the triangle_area function. The formula for the area of a triangle is: area = (base * height) / 2

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:24:01 ---
  command:
    triangle_area: {[a;h] (a*h)%2};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:24:01 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:24:00 ---
Let me test it with the example from the problem:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:24:01 ---
  command:
    triangle_area[5;3]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:24:01 ---
7.5

--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:24:03 ---
Perfect! Let me test with a few more cases to ensure it works correctly:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:24:03 ---
  command:
    triangle_area[10;5]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 23:24:03 ---
25.0

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:24:06 ---
  command:
    triangle_area[2;4]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 23:24:06 ---
4.0

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:24:08 ---
  command:
    triangle_area[1;1]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 23:24:08 ---
0.5

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:24:11 ---
Excellent! The function works correctly. Now let me write it to the solution file:

--- 18. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:24:13 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_45_q_session_1e2ea706/problem_solution_45.q
  content:
    triangle_area: {[a;h] (a*h)%2}
    

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:24:18 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_45.q`. 

The implementation is a simple, idiomatic q function that calculates the area of a triangle using the formula: area = (base Ã— height) / 2. It uses q's native multiplication (`*`) and division (`%`) operators to compute the result efficiently.
