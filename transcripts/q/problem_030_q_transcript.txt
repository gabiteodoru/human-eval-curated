Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/30
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def get_positive(l: list):
    """Return only positive numbers in the list.
    >>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])
    [2, 5, 6]
    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: get_positive

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_30.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:09:03 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:09:06 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. The task is to filter a list to return only positive numbers (greater than 0).

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:09:06 ---
  command:
    get_positive: {x where x > 0}

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:09:06 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:09:09 ---
  command:
    get_positive[-1 2 -4 5 6]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:09:09 ---
List_Int64([2, 5, 6])

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:09:12 ---
  command:
    get_positive[5 3 -5 2 -3 3 9 0 123 1 -10]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 23:09:12 ---
List_Int64([5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1])

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:09:15 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly. Let me verify edge cases:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:09:15 ---
  command:
    get_positive[`long$()]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 23:09:15 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:09:18 ---
  command:
    get_positive[-1 -2 -3]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:09:18 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:09:17 ---
  command:
    get_positive[0 0 0]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:09:18 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:09:21 ---
Excellent! All test cases pass. Now I'll write the solution to the file:

--- 19. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:09:23 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_30_q_session_619f10d5/problem_solution_30.q
  content:
    get_positive: {x where x > 0}
    

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:09:27 ---
Done! The solution uses idiomatic q with a vectorized approach: `x where x > 0` filters the list to return only positive numbers.
