Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/71
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: triangle_area

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_71.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll help you solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+. Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

Good! Now let me develop the triangle area calculation. The key steps are:
1. Check if the three sides form a valid triangle (triangle inequality)
2. If valid, use Heron's formula to calculate the area
3. Round to 2 decimal places
4. Return -1 if invalid

Let me implement and test this:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:47:51 ---
  command:
    triangle_area: {[a;b;c]
      valid: (a+b>c) and (a+c>b) and (b+c>a);
      $[valid;
        [s: (a+b+c)%2;
         area: sqrt s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c);
         0.01*floor 0.5+area*100];
        -1]
      };

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:47:54 ---
Now let me test it with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:47:54 ---
  command:
    triangle_area[3;4;5]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:47:54 ---

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:47:57 ---
  command:
    triangle_area[1;2;10]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:47:57 ---
nan

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:48:00 ---
I see there's an issue with my implementation. When the triangle is invalid, it's returning `nan` instead of `-1`. Let me fix this:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:01 ---
  command:
    triangle_area: {[a;b;c]
      valid: (a+b>c) and (a+c>b) and (b+c>a);
      $[valid;
        [s: (a+b+c)%2;
         area: sqrt s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c);
         0.01*floor 0.5+area*100];
        -1f]
      };

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 23:48:01 ---
None

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:03 ---
  command:
    triangle_area[1;2;10]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 23:48:03 ---
nan

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:48:04 ---
Let me check what's happening. The issue is that the conditional is being evaluated in a way where both branches might be getting computed. Let me rewrite it more carefully:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:05 ---
  command:
    triangle_area: {[a;b;c]
      $[(a+b>c) and (a+c>b) and (b+c>a);
        [s: (a+b+c)%2;
         area: sqrt s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c);
         0.01*floor 0.5+area*100];
        -1f]
      };

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 23:48:05 ---
None

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:08 ---
  command:
    triangle_area[1;2;10]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 23:48:08 ---
nan

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:48:10 ---
Let me debug this step by step to understand what's happening:

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:11 ---
  command:
    a:1; b:2; c:10; (a+b>c) and (a+c>b) and (b+c>a)

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 23:48:11 ---
1

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:48:14 ---
That's the problem! The condition is evaluating to `1` (true) when it should be `0` (false). Let me check the individual conditions:

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:15 ---
  command:
    a:1; b:2; c:10; (a+b>c; a+c>b; b+c>a)

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 23:48:15 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 3])

--- 28. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:48:18 ---
I see the issue - I'm getting the sums instead of the boolean comparisons. Let me check properly:

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:18 ---
  command:
    a:1; b:2; c:10; a+b>c

--- 30. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #29) at 23:48:18 ---
1

--- 31. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:21 ---
  command:
    1+2>10

--- 32. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #31) at 23:48:21 ---
1

--- 33. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:48:25 ---
Ah! This is an operator precedence issue in q. The `>` is being evaluated before `+`. I need to use parentheses:

--- 34. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:25 ---
  command:
    (1+2)>10

--- 35. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #34) at 23:48:25 ---
False

--- 36. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:48:29 ---
Perfect! Now let me fix the function:

--- 37. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:32 ---
  command:
    triangle_area: {[a;b;c]
      $[((a+b)>c) and ((a+c)>b) and ((b+c)>a);
        [s: (a+b+c)%2;
         area: sqrt s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c);
         0.01*floor 0.5+area*100];
        -1f]
      };

--- 38. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #37) at 23:48:32 ---
None

--- 39. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:48:32 ---
Now let me test both examples:

--- 40. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:32 ---
  command:
    triangle_area[1;2;10]

--- 41. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #40) at 23:48:32 ---
-1.0

--- 42. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:34 ---
  command:
    triangle_area[3;4;5]

--- 43. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #42) at 23:48:34 ---
6.0

--- 44. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:48:38 ---
Perfect! Both test cases pass. Let me test a few more edge cases to make sure the solution is robust:

--- 45. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:39 ---
  command:
    triangle_area[5;12;13]

--- 46. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #45) at 23:48:39 ---
30.0

--- 47. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:48:42 ---
  command:
    triangle_area[1;1;3]

--- 48. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #47) at 23:48:42 ---
-1.0

--- 49. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:48:44 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 50. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:48:47 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_71_q_session_02b09fe1/problem_solution_71.q
  content:
    triangle_area: {[a;b;c]
      $[((a+b)>c) and ((a+c)>b) and ((b+c)>a);
        [s: (a+b+c)%2;
         area: sqrt s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c);
         0.01*floor 0.5+area*100];
        -1f]
      }
    

--- 51. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:48:52 ---
Solution complete! The `triangle_area` function:
1. Validates the triangle using the triangle inequality theorem with proper parentheses for operator precedence
2. Calculates the area using Heron's formula if valid
3. Rounds to 2 decimal places
4. Returns -1 for invalid triangles
