Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/129
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def minPath(grid, k):
    """
    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

    Examples:

        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
        Output: [1, 2, 1]

        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1
        Output: [1]

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: minPath

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_129.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 09:55:33 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:55:38 ---
Good! Now let me analyze the problem:
1. Given an NxN grid and integer k
2. Find a path of length k that is lexicographically minimal
3. Can start anywhere, move to adjacent cells (up/down/left/right)
4. Path visits k cells (can revisit)

Key insight: To get the lexicographically smallest path, we should:
- Find the minimum value in the grid
- At each step, choose the minimum neighbor we can move to
- Since we can revisit cells, we can alternate between the minimum cell and its smallest neighbor

Let me develop the solution:

      (k#minVal,minNeighbor)til k
     }
    

--- 34. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:56:40 ---
Solution complete! The implementation:

1. **Finds the minimum value** in the grid and its position
2. **Calculates valid neighbors** using vectorized operations on direction offsets
3. **Finds the minimum neighbor** value
4. **Constructs the path** by alternating between the minimum value and its smallest neighbor

The key insight is that the lexicographically smallest path of length k always starts at the minimum value in the grid and alternates with its smallest neighbor, since we can revisit cells.
