Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/7
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring
    >>> filter_by_substring([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'bacd', 'array']
    >>> filter_by_substring(['hello', 'world', 'help'], 'el')
    ['hello', 'help']
    >>> filter_by_substring(['python', 'java', 'javascript'], 'java')
    ['java', 'javascript']
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: filter_by_substring

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_7.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Now let me develop the solution. The task is to filter strings that contain a given substring. In q, I can use the `ss` (string search) function or `like` operator.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:46:18 ---
  command:
    / Test string search - ss returns positions where pattern is found
    ss["hello"; "el"]

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:46:18 ---
List_Int64([1])

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:46:21 ---
  command:
    / ss returns empty list if not found
    ss["hello"; "xyz"]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 22:46:21 ---

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:46:24 ---
  command:
    / Check if substring exists by testing if ss result is non-empty
    count ss["hello"; "el"]

    / Vectorized approach - apply ss to each string

    strings

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 22:46:28 ---

  command:
    / Check which strings contain "a"
    strings: ("abc"; "bacd"; "cde"; "array");
    substring: "a";
    count each ss[;substring] each strings

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 22:46:32 ---

    strings where mask

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 22:46:39 ---
List_Untyped([String("abc"), String("bacd"), String("array")])

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:46:42 ---
Perfect! Now let me create the function and test it with all the examples:

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:46:43 ---
  command:
    / Define the function
    filter_by_substring: {[strings; substring] strings where 0 < count each ss[;substring] each strings};
    filter_by_substring

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 22:46:43 ---
QLambda('{[strings; substring] strings where 0 < count each ss[;substring] each strings}')

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:46:46 ---
  command:
    / Test 1: empty list
    filter_by_substring[(); "a"]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 22:46:46 ---
List_Untyped([])

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:46:49 ---
  command:
    / Test 2: filter by "a"
    filter_by_substring[("abc"; "bacd"; "cde"; "array"); "a"]

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 22:46:50 ---
List_Untyped([String("abc"), String("bacd"), String("array")])

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:46:52 ---
  command:
    / Test 3: filter by "el"
    filter_by_substring[("hello"; "world"; "help"); "el"]

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 22:46:52 ---
List_Untyped([String("hello"), String("help")])

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:46:55 ---
  command:
    / Test 4: filter by "java"
    filter_by_substring[("python"; "java"; "javascript"); "java"]

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 22:46:55 ---
List_Untyped([String("java"), String("javascript")])

--- 30. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:46:59 ---
Excellent! All tests pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 31. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:47:01 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_7_q_session_93582af2/problem_solution_7.q
  content:
    filter_by_substring: {[strings; substring] strings where 0 < count each ss[;substring] each strings}
    

--- 32. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:47:07 ---
Perfect! The solution is complete. The function:
- Uses `ss[;substring]` to search for the substring in each string
- Returns positions where substring is found (empty list if not found)
- Uses `count each` to get the number of matches in each string
- Creates a boolean mask with `0 <` to identify strings containing the substring
- Filters the original list using `where` to return only matching strings

All test cases pass successfully.
