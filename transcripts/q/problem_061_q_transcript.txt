Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/61
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: correct_bracketing

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_61.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop a solution for bracket matching.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:38:09 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:38:13 ---
Great! Now let me develop the solution. The key insight is that for brackets to be correctly balanced:
1. Running sum of +1 for "(" and -1 for ")" should never go negative
2. Final sum should be 0

Let me implement and test this:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:38:15 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing: {[brackets] depth: sums ?[brackets="(";1;-1]; (0=last depth) and (min depth)>=0}

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:38:15 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:38:15 ---
Now let's test it with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:38:15 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing["("]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:38:15 ---
False

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:38:18 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing["()"]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:38:18 ---

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:38:21 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing["(()())"]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 23:38:21 ---

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:38:23 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing[")(()"]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:38:23 ---
False

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:38:26 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me test a few edge cases:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:38:26 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing[""]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 23:38:26 ---
False

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:38:29 ---
Hmm, empty string returns False but it should return True (no brackets means balanced). Let me fix this:

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:38:30 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing: {[brackets] depth: sums ?[brackets="(";1;-1]; (0=last depth) and 0<=(min depth)}

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 23:38:30 ---
None

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:38:33 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing[""]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 23:38:33 ---
False

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:38:35 ---
Let me debug this to understand what's happening with empty string:

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:38:36 ---
  command:
    depth: sums ?[""="(";1;-1]; depth

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 23:38:36 ---

MAXVAL_int64

--- 33. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:38:47 ---
I see - `last` and `min` of empty lists don't behave as I expected. Let me handle the empty case explicitly:

--- 34. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:38:48 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing: {[brackets] $[0=count brackets; 1b; depth: sums ?[brackets="(";1;-1]; (0=last depth) and 0<=(min depth)]}

--- 36. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:38:51 ---
  command:

--- 37. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #36) at 23:38:51 ---
True

--- 38. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:38:53 ---
Great! Now let me verify all test cases still work:

--- 39. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:38:54 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing each ("("; "()"; "(()())"; ")(()"; "")

--- 76. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:39:46 ---
Solution complete! The function uses a vectorized approach:
- Converts each "(" to 1 and ")" to -1
- Uses `sums` to track running depth
- Checks that final depth is 0 (balanced) and minimum depth ≥ 0 (no closing before opening)
