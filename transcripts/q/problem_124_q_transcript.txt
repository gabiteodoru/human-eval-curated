Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/124
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def valid_date(date):
    """You have to write a function which validates a given date string and
    returns True if the date is valid otherwise False.
    The date is valid if all of the following rules are satisfied:
    1. The date string is not empty.
    2. The number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 31 days for months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12. And the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 30 days for months 4,6,9,11. And, the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 29 for the month 2.
    3. The months should not be less than 1 or higher than 12.
    4. The date should be in the format: mm-dd-yyyy

    for example: 
    valid_date('03-11-2000') => True

    valid_date('15-01-2012') => False

    valid_date('04-0-2040') => False

    valid_date('06-04-2020') => True

    valid_date('06/04/2020') => False
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: valid_date

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_124.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 09:43:01 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:43:05 ---
Now let me analyze the problem and develop a solution:

1. Check if the date string is not empty
2. Check format is mm-dd-yyyy
3. Validate month (1-12)
4. Validate day based on the month:
   - Months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12: 1-31 days
   - Months 4,6,9,11: 1-30 days
   - Month 2: 1-29 days

Let me develop and test the solution:

      parts: "-" vs dt;
      
      / Check format: should have exactly 3 parts
      if[3<>count parts; :0b];
      
      / Extract parts
      mm: parts 0;

      max_days: days_in_month[month];
      
      / Validate day
      if[(day<1) or day>max_days; :0b];
      
      / If all checks pass

--- 35. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:44:04 ---
Solution complete! The `valid_date` function has been written to `problem_solution_124.q`. 

The implementation:
- Validates non-empty dates in mm-dd-yyyy format
- Checks months are 1-12
- Validates days based on month (31 for months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12; 30 for months 4,6,9,11; 29 for month 2)
- Returns boolean true/false

All test cases pass successfully.
