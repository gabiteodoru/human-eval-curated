Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/130
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of floats of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) => [1.0, 3.0, 2.0, 8.0]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: tri

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_130.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and understand the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:16:04 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:16:07 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- tri(1) = 3
- tri(n) = 1 + n/2 if n is even
- tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1) if n is odd
- Return first n+1 numbers of the sequence

The tricky part is that for odd n, we need tri(n+1), which creates a forward dependency. Let me work through the examples to understand the pattern:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:16:09 ---
  command:
    / Let's trace through tri(3) manually
    / tri(0) - not defined in problem, but from examples it appears to be 1.0
    / tri(1) = 3
    / tri(2) = 1 + 2/2 = 2
    / tri(3) needs tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
    / tri(4) = 1 + 4/2 = 3
    / So tri(3) = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8
    / Expected output: [1.0, 3.0, 2.0, 8.0]

I need to build the sequence iteratively since odd positions depend on the next even position. Let me develop the solution:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:16:17 ---
  command:
    / First attempt - iterative construction
    tri: {[n]
      if[n<0; :()];

      if[n=0; :result];
      result[1]: 3f;
      if[n=1; :result];
      
      / Fill even positions first (they don't depend on future values)
      i: 2;
      while[i<=n;
        if[0=i mod 2;
          result[i]: 1f + i%2f
        ];
        i+: 1
      ];
      
      / Now fill odd positions (they depend on already computed values)
      i: 3;
      while[i<=n;
        if[1=i mod 2;
          result[i]: result[i-1] + result[i-2] + result[i+1]
        ];
        i+: 1
      ];
      
      :result
     };

I see the issue - when i=3, result[i+1]=result[4] might not exist yet. Let me reconsider the approach. I need to compute even positions first, then odd positions:

      / Fill all even positions first (indices 2,4,6,...)

      result[evens]: 1f + evens%2f;
      
      / Now fill all odd positions (indices 3,5,7,...)

- tri(5) = tri(4) + tri(3) + tri(6)
- tri(4) = 3, tri(3) = 8, tri(6) = 1 + 6/2 = 4

Solution complete! The `tri` function implements the Tribonacci sequence with the following approach:

1. Handle base cases: tri(0)=1.0, tri(1)=3.0
2. Compute even positions vectorially: tri(n) = 1 + n/2
3. Compute odd positions sequentially since each depends on the previous odd position
4. For odd n, compute one extra position (n+1) since tri(n) needs tri(n+1)
5. Return first n+1 elements

The solution is written to `problem_solution_130.q`.
