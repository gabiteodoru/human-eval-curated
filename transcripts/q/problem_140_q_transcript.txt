Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/140
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def fix_spaces(text):
    """
    Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, 
    and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, 
    then replace all consecutive spaces with - 
    
    fix_spaces("Example") == "Example"
    fix_spaces("Example 1") == "Example_1"
    fix_spaces(" Example 2") == "_Example_2"
    fix_spaces(" Example   3") == "_Example-3"
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: fix_spaces

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_140.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 10:07:14 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:07:18 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. The problem requires:
1. Replace single spaces with underscores
2. Replace 3+ consecutive spaces with a single dash
3. Replace 2 consecutive spaces with underscores

Let me start by exploring the approach:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:07:19 ---
  command:
    / Test string manipulation
    text: "Example";
    text

String("Example")

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:07:22 ---
  command:
    / Understand consecutive spaces detection

List_Bool([True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, True, True, True, False])

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:07:25 ---
Let me develop a solution using q's group-by functionality to identify consecutive spaces:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:07:26 ---
  command:
    / Approach: Use differ to find runs
    text: " Example   3";

    boundaries

List_Bool([True, True, False, False, False, False, False, False, True, False, False, True])

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:07:29 ---
Let me develop a solution using a different approach - I'll process the string by identifying runs of consecutive spaces:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:07:30 ---
  command:
    / Better approach: use where and deltas to find runs
    text: " Example   3";

String("_Example-3")

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:07:50 ---
Great! But I need to handle the case where there are more than 3 consecutive spaces properly. Let me refine:

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:07:50 ---
  command:
    / Test with 4+ spaces
    fix_spaces["a    b"]

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 10:07:50 ---
String("a-_b")

--- 28. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:07:53 ---
That's incorrect - it should be "a-b". I need to handle all consecutive spaces (3+) at once. Let me use a better approach:

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:07:56 ---
  command:
    / Better approach: iteratively replace all groups of 3+ spaces
    fix_spaces: {[text]
      / Keep replacing 3+ spaces with a marker until none left
      t: text;
      while[count ss[t;"   "]; t: ssr[t;"   ";"-"]];
      / Now replace remaining spaces (1-2) with underscores
      t: ssr[t;" ";"_"];
      t
      };
    fix_spaces["a    b"]

--- 30. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #29) at 10:07:56 ---
String("a-_b")

--- 31. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:07:59 ---
Still wrong. The issue is after replacing "   " with "-", we still have a space left. Let me think differently - I need to replace the entire run of 3+ spaces with a single dash:

--- 32. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:08:02 ---
  command:
    / New approach: mark runs, then replace
    fix_spaces: {[text]
      t: text;
      / Replace runs of 3+ spaces with single dash
      / Keep replacing 3 spaces with 1 space until we have <=2 consecutive
      while[count ss[t;"   "]; t: ssr[t;"   ";" "]];
      / Now we have max 2 consecutive spaces
      / Replace remaining spaces with underscores
      t: ssr[t;" ";"_"];
      t
      };
    fix_spaces["a    b"]

--- 33. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #32) at 10:08:02 ---
String("a__b")

--- 34. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:08:06 ---
I need to rethink this. Let me use a marker-based approach where I first mark all runs of 3+ spaces, then process:

--- 35. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:08:08 ---
  command:
    / Use a unique marker that won't appear in text
    fix_spaces: {[text]
      t: text;
      / Replace 3+ space runs with marker + remaining spaces
      / First mark positions with 3+ spaces
      while[count ss[t;"   "]; t: ssr[t;"   ";"\001"]];
      / Now replace single spaces with underscores
      t: ssr[t;" ";"_"];
      / Replace markers with dash
      t: ssr[t;"\001";"-"];
      t
      };
    fix_spaces["a    b"]

--- 36. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #35) at 10:08:09 ---
String("a-_b")

--- 37. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:08:12 ---
Still getting an extra underscore. The problem is that 4 spaces becomes: marker + 1 space. Let me replace differently:

--- 38. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:08:16 ---
  command:
    / Replace sets of 3 spaces with marker, recursively
    fix_spaces: {[text]
      t: text;
      / Replace every group of 3 consecutive spaces with a single marker
      while[count ss[t;"   "]; t: ssr[t;"   ";"\001"]];
      / Replace any remaining single spaces with underscores
      t: ssr[t;" ";"_"];
      / Replace markers with dashes  
      t: ssr[t;"\001";"-"];
      t
      };
    / Test: "    " = 4 spaces -> "\001 " (after first pass) -> still has "   "? No
    / Let's trace it
    text: "a    b";
    t: ssr[text;"   ";"\001"];
    t

--- 39. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #38) at 10:08:16 ---

  command:
    / Trace further

    / Check if there are still 3 spaces
    count ss[t;"   "]

  command:
    / So "a    b" (4 spaces) becomes "a\001 b" (marker + 1 space)
    / That's the issue! The first replacement of 3 spaces leaves 1 space
    / I need to consume ALL consecutive spaces when there are 3+
    / Better: use a different strategy - identify runs first
    fix_spaces: {[text]
      t: text;

Let me try a cleaner approach - replace 2 spaces with a marker first:

  command:
    / New strategy: work with pairs
    fix_spaces: {[text]

      / Replace all pairs of spaces with marker

      / Now if we have marker followed by space(s), it was 3+ originally
      / marker = 2 spaces, marker+space = 3, marker+marker = 4, etc
      / Check if marker is followed by space or marker
      while[count ss[t;"\001 "]; t: ssr[t;"\001 ";"\002"]];
      while[count ss[t;"\001\001"]; t: ssr[t;"\001\001";"\002"]];

There's still an issue. Let me check the logic more carefully:

--- 79. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:09:48 ---
  command:
    / Debug step by step
    text: "a     b";
    isSpace: text=" ";
    boundaries: 0b, differ isSpace;
    runIds: sums boundaries;
    / Check run 0
    indices: where runIds=0;
    chars: text[indices];
    (indices; chars; all chars=" ")

--- 80. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #79) at 10:09:48 ---
List_Untyped([List_Int64([0]), String("a"), False])

--- 81. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:09:52 ---
  command:
    / Check run 1 (the spaces)
    text: "a     b";
    isSpace: text=" ";
    boundaries: 0b, differ isSpace;
    runIds: sums boundaries;
    indices: where runIds=1;
    chars: text[indices];
    (indices; chars; all chars=" "; count chars)

--- 82. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #81) at 10:09:52 ---
List_Untyped([List_Int64([1]), String(" "), True, 1])

--- 83. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:09:55 ---
Ah! The problem is my differ logic. Let me fix it:

--- 84. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:09:57 ---
  command:
    / The issue is I need to not prepend 0b
    fix_spaces: {[text]
      / Split into runs of same character type (space vs non-space)
      isSpace: text=" ";
      boundaries: differ isSpace;
      runIds: sums boundaries;
      / Process each run in order
      result: "";
      i: 0;
      while[i <= max runIds;
        indices: where runIds=i;
        if[count indices;
          chars: text[indices];
          if[all chars=" ";
            n: count chars;
            result,: $[n>=3; "-"; n=2; "__"; "_"]
          ];
          if[not all chars=" ";
            result,: chars
          ]
        ];
        i+: 1
      ];
      result
      };
    fix_spaces["a     b"]

--- 85. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #84) at 10:09:57 ---
String("a-b")

--- 86. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:09:59 ---
Perfect! Let me test all the examples again:

--- 87. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:10:00 ---
  command:
    / Test all examples
    (fix_spaces["Example"]; fix_spaces["Example 1"]; fix_spaces[" Example 2"]; fix_spaces[" Example   3"])

--- 88. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #87) at 10:10:00 ---
List_Untyped([String("Example"), String("Example_1"), String("_Example_2"), String("_Example-3")])

--- 89. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:10:03 ---
Excellent! Let me test more edge cases:

--- 90. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:10:04 ---
  command:
    / More edge cases
    (fix_spaces["a  b"]; fix_spaces["a    b"]; fix_spaces["  a  b  "]; fix_spaces[""])

--- 91. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #90) at 10:10:04 ---
List_Untyped([String("a__b"), String("a-b"), String("__a__b__"), String("")])

--- 92. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:10:07 ---
Perfect! All tests pass. Now let me write the solution to a file:

        if[count indices;

          ]
        ];
        i+: 1
      ];
      result
      };

Solution complete! The function:

1. Identifies runs of consecutive spaces vs non-spaces using `differ` to mark boundaries
2. Groups characters by run ID using `sums` 
3. Processes each run in order:
   - For space runs: replaces with `-` (3+ spaces), `__` (2 spaces), or `_` (1 space)
   - For non-space runs: keeps the original characters
4. Concatenates all processed runs into the result string
