Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/35
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: max_element

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_35.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:12:09 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:12:13 ---
Now let me implement and test the `max_element` function. In q, this is straightforward using the built-in `max` function:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:12:14 ---
  command:
    max_element: {max x};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:12:14 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:12:13 ---
Let me test it with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:12:14 ---
  command:
    max_element[1 2 3]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:12:14 ---
3

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:12:16 ---
  command:
    max_element[5 3 -5 2 -3 3 9 0 123 1 -10]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:12:16 ---
123

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:12:19 ---
Perfect! Both test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 13. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:12:20 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_35_q_session_d8eef25b/problem_solution_35.q
  content:
    max_element: {max x}
    

--- 14. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:12:24 ---
Solution complete! The `max_element` function is implemented using q's built-in `max` function, which is the idiomatic way to find the maximum element in a list. The function has been tested with both provided examples and written to `problem_solution_35.q`.
