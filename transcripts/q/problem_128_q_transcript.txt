Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/128
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def prod_signs(arr):
    """
    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
    Note: return None for empty arr.

    Example:
    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9
    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0
    >>> prod_signs([]) == None
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: prod_signs

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_128.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:15:25 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:15:29 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
1. Return null (None) for empty array
2. Calculate sum of magnitudes (absolute values)
3. Multiply by product of all signs (1, -1, or 0)
4. If any element is 0, the product of signs is 0

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:15:31 ---
  command:
    prod_signs: {[arr] if[0=count arr; :()]; signs: signum arr; prod: prd signs; sum_mag: sum abs arr; prod * sum_mag};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:15:31 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:15:33 ---
  command:
    prod_signs[1 2 2 -4]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 07:15:33 ---
-9

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:15:35 ---
  command:
    prod_signs[0 1]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 07:15:35 ---
0

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:15:37 ---
  command:
    prod_signs[()] 

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 07:15:37 ---
List_Untyped([])

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:15:40 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me verify a few more edge cases:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:15:40 ---
  command:
    prod_signs[-1 -2 -3]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 07:15:40 ---
-6

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:15:43 ---
  command:
    prod_signs[-1 1 -1 1]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 07:15:43 ---
4

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:15:47 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 19. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:15:49 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_128_q_session_87068366/problem_solution_128.q
  content:
    prod_signs: {[arr]
      if[0=count arr; :()];
      signs: signum arr;
      prod: prd signs;
      sum_mag: sum abs arr;
      prod * sum_mag}
    

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:15:53 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_128.q`.

The implementation:
- Returns `()` (null) for empty arrays
- Uses `signum` to get signs (-1, 0, or 1)
- Uses `prd` to get the product of all signs
- Uses `abs` to get magnitudes and `sum` for the total
- Multiplies the product of signs by the sum of magnitudes
