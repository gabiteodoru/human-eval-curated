Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/53
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def add(x: int, y: int):
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: add

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_53.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll help you solve this HumanEval problem in q/kdb+. Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:31:20 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

Now let me implement and test the `add` function. This is a simple function that adds two numbers:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:31:22 ---
  command:
    add: {[x;y] x+y};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:31:22 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:31:25 ---
  command:
    add[2;3]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:31:25 ---
5

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:31:27 ---
  command:
    add[5;7]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 23:31:27 ---
12

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:31:30 ---
Perfect! The function works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 12. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:31:31 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_53_q_session_133339aa/problem_solution_53.q
  content:
    add: {[x;y] x+y}
    

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:31:35 ---
Solution complete! I've implemented the `add` function in q/kdb+ that adds two numbers together. The function is straightforward - it takes two parameters `x` and `y` and returns their sum using q's native `+` operator. The implementation has been tested with the provided examples and written to `problem_solution_53.q`.
