Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/1
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List


def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: separate_paren_groups

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_1.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEal problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution:

  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:38:28 ---
Now let me develop the solution. The algorithm needs to:
1. Remove spaces from the input
2. Track the depth of nested parentheses
3. Split groups when depth returns to 0

Perfect! Now let me create the complete function and test it:

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:38:56 ---
  command:
    separate_paren_groups: {[paren_string]
      s: paren_string except " ";
      depths: sums ?[s="(";1;-1];
      endpoints: where depths=0;
      cutpoints: 1+endpoints;
      (0,cutpoints except count s) cut s
      };
    separate_paren_groups["( ) (( )) (( )( ))"]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 09:38:56 ---
List_Untyped([String("()"), String("(())"), String("(()())")])

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:38:59 ---

List_Untyped([String("(()(()))")])

--- 28. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:39:08 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 29. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 09:39:10 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_1_q_session_77e001dd/problem_solution_1.q
  content:
    separate_paren_groups: {[paren_string]
      s: paren_string except " ";
      depths: sums ?[s="(";1;-1];
      endpoints: where depths=0;
      cutpoints: 1+endpoints;
      (0,cutpoints except count s) cut s
      }
    

--- 30. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:39:15 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_1.q`.

**Solution Overview:**
1. **Remove spaces**: `paren_string except " "`
2. **Calculate depth**: Use `sums` with conditional to track nesting level (+1 for `(`, -1 for `)`)
3. **Find group boundaries**: `where depths=0` gives positions where groups end
4. **Extract groups**: Use `cut` to split at the boundaries

The solution is fully vectorized, using q's native operations (`sums`, `where`, `cut`) without explicit loops.
