Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/82
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def prime_length(string):
    """Write a function that takes a string and returns True if the string
    length is a prime number or False otherwise
    Examples
    prime_length('Hello') == True
    prime_length('abcdcba') == True
    prime_length('kittens') == True
    prime_length('orange') == False
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: prime_length

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_82.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:59:18 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:59:19 ---
Good! Now let me develop the solution. I need to:
1. Create a function that checks if a number is prime
2. Use it to check if the length of a string is prime

Let me start by creating a helper function to check if a number is prime:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:59:21 ---
  command:
    isPrime: {[n] $[n<2; 0b; n=2; 1b; not any 0=n mod 2+til floor sqrt n-1; 1b; 0b]};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:59:21 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:59:24 ---
  command:
    isPrime each 1+til 20

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:59:24 ---
List_Bool([False, True, True, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True, False, True, False])

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:59:26 ---
Great! The prime checker works. Now let me create the main function that checks if string length is prime:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:59:27 ---
  command:
    prime_length: {[string] isPrime count string};

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:59:27 ---
None

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:59:30 ---
Now let me test the solution with the examples from the problem:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:59:30 ---
  command:
    prime_length["Hello"]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 23:59:30 ---
Error: match
Trace:
  [4]  prime_length:{[string] isPrime count string}
                    ^
  [3]  prime_length["Hello"]
       ^


--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:59:34 ---
I see the issue - I need to handle the fact that in q, strings are character lists. Let me test the count first:

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:59:34 ---
  command:
    count "Hello"

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:59:34 ---
5

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:59:37 ---
  command:
    isPrime 5

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 23:59:37 ---
True

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:59:40 ---
The issue is with my isPrime function. Let me fix it - the logic for checking divisors is wrong:

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:59:41 ---
  command:
    isPrime: {[n] $[n<2; 0b; n=2; 1b; 0=n mod 2; 0b; not any 0=n mod 3+2*til floor(sqrt[n]-1)%2; 1b; 0b]};

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 23:59:41 ---
None

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:59:44 ---
Let me simplify and fix the isPrime function:

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:59:45 ---
  command:
    isPrime: {[n] $[n<2; 0b; not any 0=n mod 2+til n-2; 1b; 0b]};

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 23:59:46 ---
None

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:59:46 ---
  command:
    isPrime each 1+til 20

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 23:59:46 ---
List_Bool([False, True, True, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True, False, True, False])

--- 28. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:59:49 ---
Good! Now let me test the prime_length function:

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:59:49 ---
  command:
    prime_length "Hello"

--- 30. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #29) at 23:59:49 ---
Error: match
Trace:
  [4]  prime_length:{[string] isPrime count string}
                    ^
  [3]  prime_length "Hello"
       ^


--- 31. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:59:51 ---
Let me check what's happening step by step:

--- 32. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:59:52 ---
  command:
    s: "Hello"; n: count s; isPrime n

--- 33. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #32) at 23:59:52 ---
True

--- 34. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:59:55 ---
The issue seems to be with the parameter name. Let me redefine using a different parameter name:

--- 35. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:59:55 ---
  command:
    prime_length: {[s] isPrime count s};

--- 36. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #35) at 23:59:55 ---
None

--- 37. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:59:58 ---
  command:
    prime_length "Hello"

--- 38. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #37) at 23:59:58 ---
True

--- 39. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:00:01 ---
Perfect! Now let me test all the examples:

--- 40. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:00:02 ---
  command:
    prime_length "Hello"

--- 41. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #40) at 00:00:02 ---
True

--- 42. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:00:04 ---
  command:
    prime_length "abcdcba"

--- 43. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #42) at 00:00:04 ---
True

--- 44. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:00:07 ---
  command:
    prime_length "kittens"

--- 45. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #44) at 00:00:07 ---
True

--- 46. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:00:10 ---
  command:
    prime_length "orange"

--- 47. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #46) at 00:00:10 ---
False

--- 48. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:00:13 ---
Excellent! All test cases pass. Let me verify the lengths:

--- 49. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:00:14 ---
  command:
    count each ("Hello"; "abcdcba"; "kittens"; "orange")

--- 50. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #49) at 00:00:14 ---
List_Int64([5, 7, 7, 6])

--- 51. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:00:18 ---
Perfect! 5, 7, and 7 are prime, while 6 is not. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 52. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 00:00:19 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_82_q_session_043f40c0/problem_solution_82.q
  content:
    / Helper function to check if a number is prime
    isPrime: {[n] $[n<2; 0b; not any 0=n mod 2+til n-2; 1b; 0b]};
    
    / Main function: returns true if string length is prime
    prime_length: {[s] isPrime count s};
    

--- 53. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:00:24 ---
Solution complete! The implementation:

- `isPrime`: Helper function that checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility against all numbers from 2 to n-1
- `prime_length`: Main function that counts the string length and checks if it's prime

All test cases pass:
- "Hello" (length 5) → True ✓
- "abcdcba" (length 7) → True ✓  
- "kittens" (length 7) → True ✓
- "orange" (length 6) → False ✓
