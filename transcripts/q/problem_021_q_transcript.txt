Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/21
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
    [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: rescale_to_unit

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_21.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 22:59:52 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:59:55 ---
Now let me develop and test the `rescale_to_unit` function:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:59:56 ---
  command:
    rescale_to_unit: {[numbers] minVal: min numbers; maxVal: max numbers; (numbers - minVal) % (maxVal - minVal)};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:59:56 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:59:58 ---
Let me test it with the example from the problem:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:59:59 ---
  command:
    rescale_to_unit[1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 22:59:59 ---
List_Float64([0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0])

--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:59:59 ---
Perfect! Let me test with a few more cases to ensure it works correctly:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:00:00 ---
  command:
    rescale_to_unit[2.0 1.0]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 23:00:00 ---
List_Float64([1.0, 0.0])

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:00:02 ---
  command:
    rescale_to_unit[10.0 20.0 30.0]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 23:00:02 ---
List_Float64([0.0, 0.5, 1.0])

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:00:06 ---
  command:
    rescale_to_unit[-5.0 0.0 5.0]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 23:00:06 ---
List_Float64([0.0, 0.5, 1.0])

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:00:08 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 18. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:00:11 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_21_q_session_13859a4f/problem_solution_21.q
  content:
    rescale_to_unit: {[numbers] minVal: min numbers; maxVal: max numbers; (numbers - minVal) % (maxVal - minVal)};
    

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:00:16 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_21.q`.

The implementation uses pure vectorized q operations:
- `min numbers` and `max numbers` find the range bounds
- `(numbers - minVal) % (maxVal - minVal)` applies the linear transformation to rescale all values to [0,1]

This leverages q's strength in vector operations, performing the calculation on the entire list at once.
