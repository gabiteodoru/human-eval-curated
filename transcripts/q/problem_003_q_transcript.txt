Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/3
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fallls below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: below_zero

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_3.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 22:43:34 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:43:38 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- We need to track the running balance starting from 0
- Check if at any point the balance falls below zero
- Return a boolean

The key insight is to use q's scan operator `\` to compute cumulative sums, then check if any value is negative.

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:43:39 ---
  command:
    below_zero: {[ops] any 0 > sums ops};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:43:39 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:43:42 ---
Now let's test with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:43:42 ---
  command:
    below_zero[1 2 3]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 22:43:42 ---
False

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:43:45 ---
  command:
    below_zero[1 2 -4 5]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 22:43:45 ---
True

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:43:45 ---
Perfect! Let me verify the logic with a few more test cases to ensure correctness:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:43:46 ---
  command:
    sums 1 2 -4 5

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 22:43:46 ---
List_Int64([1, 3, -1, 4])

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:43:49 ---
  command:
    below_zero[enlist -1]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 22:43:49 ---
True

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:43:52 ---
  command:
    below_zero[()]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 22:43:52 ---
False

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:43:56 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 20. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:43:58 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_3_q_session_bb227d98/problem_solution_3.q
  content:
    below_zero: {[ops] any 0 > sums ops}
    

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:44:04 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_3.q`.

The implementation:
- Uses `sums` to compute cumulative sums (running balance)
- Checks if any balance is below zero with `0 > sums ops`
- Returns `any` of those checks as a boolean

This is idiomatic q code that leverages vectorized operations instead of loops.
