Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/136
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    '''
    Create a function that returns a tuple (a, b), where 'a' is
    the largest (closest to zero) of negative integers, and 'b' is the smallest
    of positive integers in a list.
    If there is no negative or positive integers, return them as None.

    Examples:
    largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) == (None, 1)
    largest_smallest_integers([]) == (None, None)
    largest_smallest_integers([0]) == (None, None)
    largest_smallest_integers([-6, -4, -4, -3, -100, 1]) == (-3, 1)
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: largest_smallest_integers

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_136.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:28:50 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:28:53 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. The function needs to:
1. Find the largest (closest to zero) negative integer
2. Find the smallest (closest to zero) positive integer
3. Return null (0N) for each if they don't exist

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:28:54 ---
  command:
    / Test with basic list operations first
    lst: 2 4 1 3 5 7;
    lst where lst<0

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:28:54 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 07:28:56 ---
List_Int64([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7])

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:29:00 ---
  command:
    / Now let's build the function
    largest_smallest_integers: {[lst]
      negs: lst where lst<0;
      pos: lst where lst>0;
      a: $[0=count negs; 0N; max negs];
      b: $[0=count pos; 0N; min pos];
      (a;b)
     };
    largest_smallest_integers[2 4 1 3 5 7]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 07:29:00 ---
List_Int64([nan, 1])

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:29:04 ---
Good! Let me test with more examples:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:29:04 ---
  command:
    / Test with empty list
    largest_smallest_integers[`long$()]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 07:29:04 ---
List_Int64([nan, nan])

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:29:07 ---
  command:
    / Test with only zero
    largest_smallest_integers[enlist 0]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 07:29:07 ---
List_Int64([nan, nan])

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:29:10 ---
  command:
    / Test with negatives and positives
    largest_smallest_integers[-6 -4 -4 -3 -100 1]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 07:29:10 ---
List_Int64([-3, 1])

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:29:12 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more edge cases:

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:29:13 ---
  command:
    / Test with only negatives
    largest_smallest_integers[-6 -4 -4 -3 -100]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 07:29:13 ---
List_Int64([-3, nan])

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:29:15 ---
  command:
    / Test with only positives
    largest_smallest_integers[2 4 1 3 5 7]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 07:29:16 ---
List_Int64([nan, 1])

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:29:19 ---
  command:
    / Test with mix including zero
    largest_smallest_integers[-5 -2 0 3 7]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 07:29:19 ---
List_Int64([-2, 3])

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:29:22 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 26. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:29:26 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_136_q_session_6e7e61e5/problem_solution_136.q
  content:
    largest_smallest_integers: {[lst]
      negs: lst where lst<0;
      pos: lst where lst>0;
      a: $[0=count negs; 0N; max negs];
      b: $[0=count pos; 0N; min pos];
      (a;b)
     }
    

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:29:31 ---
Solution complete! The function `largest_smallest_integers` uses idiomatic q/kdb+ to:

1. Filter negatives with `lst where lst<0` and positives with `lst where lst>0`
2. Use `max` on negatives (largest = closest to zero)
3. Use `min` on positives (smallest = closest to zero)
4. Return `0N` (null integer) when no negatives or positives exist
5. Return a tuple `(a;b)` with the results

All test cases pass, including edge cases with empty lists, only zeros, and mixed values.
