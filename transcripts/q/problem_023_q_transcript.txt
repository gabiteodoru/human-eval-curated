Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/23
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: strlen

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_23.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:01:23 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:01:27 ---
Now let me implement and test the `strlen` function. In q, the `count` function returns the length of a list or string.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:01:27 ---
  command:
    strlen: {count x}

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:01:27 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:01:27 ---
  command:
    strlen[""]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:01:27 ---
0

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:01:31 ---
  command:
    strlen["abc"]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 23:01:31 ---
3

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:01:33 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more cases to ensure it works correctly:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:01:34 ---
  command:
    strlen["hello world"]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 23:01:34 ---
11

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:01:36 ---
  command:
    strlen["a"]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:01:36 ---
1

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:01:40 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 17. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:01:41 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_23_q_session_0fd5f991/problem_solution_23.q
  content:
    strlen: {count x}
    

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:01:45 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_23.q`. 

The implementation uses q's built-in `count` function, which returns the length of any list or string - a clean, idiomatic q solution that leverages the language's native capabilities.
