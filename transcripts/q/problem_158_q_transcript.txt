Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/158
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def find_max(words):
    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings.
    The list contains different words. Return the word with maximum number
    of unique characters. If multiple strings have maximum number of unique
    characters, return the one which comes first in lexicographical order.

    find_max(["name", "of", "string"]) == "string"
    find_max(["name", "enam", "game"]) == "enam"
    find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb" ,"cc"]) == ""aaaaaaa"
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: find_max

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_158.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:44:44 ---

Now let me understand the problem:
1. Find the word with the maximum number of unique characters
2. If there's a tie, return the lexicographically first one

Let me develop and test the solution:

    words: ("name"; "of"; "string");

    words: ("name"; "of"; "string");

    indices

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 07:44:53 ---
List_Int64([2])

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:44:56 ---
  command:
    / Test with tie - need lexicographical ordering
    words: ("name"; "enam"; "game");
    unique_counts: count each distinct each words;
    maxcount: max unique_counts;
    indices: where unique_counts = maxcount;
    candidates: words[indices];
    candidates

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 07:44:56 ---
List_Untyped([String("name"), String("enam"), String("game")])

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:44:59 ---
  command:
    / Sort candidates lexicographically and take first
    words: ("name"; "enam"; "game");
    unique_counts: count each distinct each words;
    maxcount: max unique_counts;
    indices: where unique_counts = maxcount;
    candidates: words[indices];
    sorted_candidates: asc candidates;
    sorted_candidates

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 07:44:59 ---
List_Untyped([String("enam"), String("game"), String("name")])

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:45:05 ---
  command:
    / Take the first one
    words: ("name"; "enam"; "game");
    unique_counts: count each distinct each words;
    maxcount: max unique_counts;
    indices: where unique_counts = maxcount;
    candidates: words[indices];
    sorted_candidates: asc candidates;
    first sorted_candidates

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 07:45:05 ---
String("enam")

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:45:07 ---
Perfect! Now let me create the complete function:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:45:09 ---
  command:
    find_max: {[words]
      unique_counts: count each distinct each words;
      maxcount: max unique_counts;
      indices: where unique_counts = maxcount;
      candidates: words[indices];
      first asc candidates
     };

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 07:45:09 ---
None

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:45:12 ---
Now let me test it with all the examples:

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:45:12 ---
  command:
    / Test case 1
    find_max[("name"; "of"; "string")]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 07:45:12 ---
String("string")

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:45:15 ---
  command:
    / Test case 2
    find_max[("name"; "enam"; "game")]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 07:45:15 ---
String("enam")

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:45:17 ---
  command:
    / Test case 3
    find_max[("aaaaaaa"; "bb"; "cc")]

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 07:45:18 ---
String("aaaaaaa")

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:45:21 ---
Excellent! All test cases pass. Let me verify the unique character counts for the third test case to ensure it's working correctly:

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:45:21 ---
  command:
    / Verify test case 3
    words: ("aaaaaaa"; "bb"; "cc");
    count each distinct each words

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 07:45:21 ---
List_Int64([1, 1, 1])

--- 30. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:45:25 ---
  command:
    / Check lexicographical order
    asc ("aaaaaaa"; "bb"; "cc")

--- 31. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #30) at 07:45:25 ---
List_Untyped([String("aaaaaaa"), String("bb"), String("cc")])

--- 32. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:45:28 ---
Perfect! When all have the same unique character count (1), it returns "aaaaaaa" because it's lexicographically first.

Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 33. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:45:31 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_158_q_session_f658fad3/problem_solution_158.q
  content:
    find_max: {[words]
      unique_counts: count each distinct each words;
      maxcount: max unique_counts;
      indices: where unique_counts = maxcount;
      candidates: words[indices];
      first asc candidates
     };
    

--- 34. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:45:37 ---
Solution complete! The `find_max` function:

1. **Calculates unique character counts**: `count each distinct each words` - for each word, gets distinct characters and counts them
2. **Finds the maximum count**: `max unique_counts`
3. **Identifies candidates**: `where unique_counts = maxcount` - gets indices of all words with max unique characters
4. **Returns lexicographically first**: `first asc candidates` - sorts candidates alphabetically and takes the first one

All test cases pass:
- `find_max(["name", "of", "string"])` → `"string"` (6 unique chars)
- `find_max(["name", "enam", "game"])` → `"enam"` (4 unique chars each, "enam" is first alphabetically)
- `find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb", "cc"])` → `"aaaaaaa"` (1 unique char each, "aaaaaaa" is first alphabetically)
