Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/2
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: truncate_number

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_2.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 22:43:00 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:43:02 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. The problem asks for the decimal part of a number, which is simply `number mod 1`.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:43:03 ---
  command:
    truncate_number: {x mod 1}

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:43:03 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:43:05 ---
  command:
    truncate_number[3.5]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 22:43:05 ---
0.5

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:43:08 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more cases to ensure correctness:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:43:08 ---
  command:
    truncate_number[5.0]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 22:43:08 ---
0.0

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:43:12 ---
  command:
    truncate_number[10.25]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 22:43:12 ---
0.25

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:43:15 ---
  command:
    truncate_number[1.75]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 22:43:15 ---
0.75

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:43:16 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 17. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:43:17 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_2_q_session_513eb4d1/problem_solution_2.q
  content:
    truncate_number: {x mod 1}
    

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:43:21 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_2.q`. The function `truncate_number` uses q's modulo operator (`mod 1`) to extract the decimal part of a number, which is a clean, vectorized solution that works with the language's native operations.
