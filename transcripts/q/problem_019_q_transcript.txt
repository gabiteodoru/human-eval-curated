Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/19
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List


def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """ Input is a space-delimited string of numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
    Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight' and 'nine'.
    Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest
    >>> sort_numbers('three one five')
    'one three five'
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: sort_numbers

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_19.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Now let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:58:14 ---
  command:
    / First, create a mapping from number words to their numeric values
    numberMap: `zero`one`two`three`four`five`six`seven`eight`nine!til 10;
    numberMap

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:58:14 ---
{[Symbol->Int64] "zero": 0, "one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4, "five": 5, "six": 6, "seven": 7, "eight": 8, "nine": 9}

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:58:20 ---
  command:
    / Define the sort_numbers function
    sort_numbers: {[numbers]
      if[""~numbers; :numbers];  / Handle empty string
      words: `$" " vs numbers;  / Split by space and convert to symbols
      sorted: words iasc numberMap words;  / Sort by numeric value using iasc
      " " sv string sorted  / Join back with spaces
      };
    sort_numbers["three one five"]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 22:58:20 ---
String("one three five")

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:58:22 ---
Great! Let me test a few more cases:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:58:23 ---
  command:
    / Test with more examples
    sort_numbers[""]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 22:58:23 ---
String("")

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:58:26 ---
  command:
    sort_numbers["nine eight seven six five four three two one zero"]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 22:58:26 ---
String("zero one two three four five six seven eight nine")

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:58:29 ---
  command:
    sort_numbers["five"]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 22:58:29 ---
String("five")

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:58:29 ---
  command:
    sort_numbers["zero four zero two"]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 22:58:29 ---
String("zero zero two four")

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:58:32 ---
Perfect! Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 19. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:58:36 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_19_q_session_74f9f769/problem_solution_19.q
  content:
    numberMap: `zero`one`two`three`four`five`six`seven`eight`nine!til 10;
    
    sort_numbers: {[numbers]
      if[""~numbers; :numbers];
      words: `$" " vs numbers;
      sorted: words iasc numberMap words;
      " " sv string sorted
      };
    

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:58:41 ---
Solution written to `problem_solution_19.q`. The implementation:

1. Creates a mapping from number words to their numeric values (0-9)
2. Splits the input string by spaces and converts to symbols
3. Uses `iasc` (indices ascending) to sort words by their numeric values
4. Joins the sorted words back with spaces

The solution is fully vectorized and uses idiomatic q operations.
