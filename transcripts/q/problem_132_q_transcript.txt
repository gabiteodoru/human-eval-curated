Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/132
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def is_nested(string):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a string as input which contains only square brackets.
    The function should return True if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets 
    where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

    is_nested('[[]]') ➞ True
    is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]') ➞ False
    is_nested('[][]') ➞ False
    is_nested('[]') ➞ False
    is_nested('[[][]]') ➞ True
    is_nested('[[]][[') ➞ True
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: is_nested

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_132.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

Now let me analyze the problem:
- We need to detect if there's a valid subsequence where at least one bracket is nested
- "Nested" means we have at least two levels of brackets like `[[]]`
- We need to find if there exists any point where the nesting depth is at least 2

Let me develop the solution:

    / [] -> False (depth only reaches 1)
    / [[][]] -> True (depth reaches 2)
    / [[]][[ -> True (depth reaches 2)
    
    / Strategy: track the running depth and check if it ever reaches 2 or more

I see - the depth goes negative, which means unbalanced brackets. The problem asks for a "valid subsequence" which means we need to consider only valid bracket sequences. Let me reconsider the algorithm:

I see the issue. My algorithm counts all opening brackets before and closing brackets after, but doesn't ensure they form a valid sequence. Let me reconsider:

The key insight is that for nesting to exist, we need at some point to have seen at least one `[`, then another `[`, then a matching `]`, and potentially another `]` later. This means we need depth to reach at least 2 while staying non-negative.

I need to think about this more carefully. Let me look at what "nested" means:

- `[[]]` - has depth 2 at position 1, meaning we have an opening bracket inside another opening bracket

I see position 9 has min=2, but this doesn't account for the fact that the brackets aren't properly balanced. The key issue is that to have nesting, we need the brackets to be matchable in a valid way.

Let me reconsider: maybe the algorithm needs to check if we can form a valid balanced subsequence with depth >= 2. This requires ensuring that at each step, we don't have more closing than opening brackets when we select our subsequence.

I see - position 0 has leftValid=1 and rightValid=2, giving min=1. But this is wrong because the first `[` at position 0 gets matched with the first `]` at position 1, leaving unmatched `]` characters that prevent valid nesting.

The issue is that my capping strategy doesn't properly account for the total balance. Let me think about this differently:

A valid nested subsequence means we can pick some brackets that form a balanced sequence with depth >= 2. The key constraint is the total string must allow this.

I see positions 8-14 all have min=2. This algorithm is definitely wrong for the failing case.

Let me reconsider what "valid subsequence" means. The key is that we need to be able to CHOOSE which brackets to use to form a valid nested sequence. Simply counting isn't enough - we need to ensure the brackets can actually be matched.

Let me look at the problem from a different angle - maybe we need to ensure balanced matching:
