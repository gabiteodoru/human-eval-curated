Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/15
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: string_sequence

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_15.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 22:52:39 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:52:43 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:52:44 ---
  command:
    string_sequence: {[n] " " sv string til 1+n};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:52:44 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:52:46 ---
  command:
    string_sequence[0]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 22:52:46 ---
String("0")

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:52:49 ---
  command:
    string_sequence[5]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 22:52:49 ---
String("0 1 2 3 4 5")

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:52:52 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more cases to ensure correctness:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:52:53 ---
  command:
    string_sequence[1]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 22:52:53 ---
String("0 1")

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:52:55 ---
  command:
    string_sequence[10]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 22:52:55 ---
String("0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10")

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:52:58 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 17. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:53:00 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_15_q_session_ab69fb01/problem_solution_15.q
  content:
    string_sequence: {[n] " " sv string til 1+n}
    

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:53:06 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_15.q`.

**Explanation:**
- `til 1+n` generates numbers from 0 to n inclusive (e.g., `til 6` â†’ `0 1 2 3 4 5`)
- `string` converts the numeric list to strings
- `" " sv` joins the strings with space delimiters (sv = "string value" join operator)

The solution is idiomatic q, using vectorized operations and built-in functions.
