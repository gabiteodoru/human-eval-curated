Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/14
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: all_prefixes

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_14.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll help you solve this HumanEail problem using native q/kdb+. Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing a solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 22:51:57 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:52:00 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. The problem asks for all prefixes of a string from shortest to longest.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:52:01 ---
  command:
    / Test basic string operations first
    s: "abc";
    s

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:52:01 ---
String("abc")

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:52:06 ---
  command:
    / Get count and generate indices
    s: "abc";
    count s

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 22:52:06 ---
3

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:52:09 ---
  command:
    / Generate all prefixes using sublist with each index
    s: "abc";
    (1+til count s) sublist\: s

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 22:52:09 ---
List_Untyped([String("a"), String("ab"), String("abc")])

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:52:13 ---
Perfect! This works. Let me create the function and test it:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:52:13 ---
  command:
    all_prefixes: {(1+til count x) sublist\: x};
    all_prefixes["abc"]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 22:52:13 ---
List_Untyped([String("a"), String("ab"), String("abc")])

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:52:16 ---
  command:
    / Test with more cases
    all_prefixes[""];
    all_prefixes["a"];
    all_prefixes["hello"]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 22:52:16 ---
List_Untyped([String("h"), String("he"), String("hel"), String("hell"), String("hello")])

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:52:19 ---
  command:
    all_prefixes[""]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 22:52:19 ---
List_Untyped([])

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:52:21 ---
  command:
    all_prefixes["a"]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 22:52:21 ---
String("a")

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:52:25 ---
Great! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 21. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:52:27 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_14_q_session_78560544/problem_solution_14.q
  content:
    all_prefixes: {(1+til count x) sublist\: x}
    

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:52:31 ---
Solution complete! The function `all_prefixes` uses:
- `til count x` to generate indices 0,1,2,...,n-1
- `1+` to get lengths 1,2,3,...,n
- `sublist\:` to apply sublist with each length to the input string
- This returns all prefixes from shortest to longest
