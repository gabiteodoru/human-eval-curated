Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/85
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..


    Examples:
        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: add

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_85.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 00:02:39 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:02:43 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- Given a non-empty list of integers
- Add the even elements that are at odd indices
- Example: [4, 2, 6, 7] => 2 (index 1 has value 2, which is even)

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:02:44 ---
  command:
    / Test the example first
    lst: 4 2 6 7;
    lst

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 00:02:44 ---
List_Int64([4, 2, 6, 7])

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:02:45 ---
  command:
    / Get indices
    til count lst

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 00:02:45 ---
List_Int64([0, 1, 2, 3])

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:02:48 ---
  command:
    / Find odd indices
    oddIndices: where 1 = (til count lst) mod 2;
    oddIndices

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 00:02:48 ---
List_Int64([1, 3])

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:02:52 ---
  command:
    / Get elements at odd indices
    lst[oddIndices]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 00:02:52 ---
List_Int64([2, 7])

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:02:56 ---
  command:
    / Filter for even elements
    evenElements: lst[oddIndices] where 0 = lst[oddIndices] mod 2;
    evenElements

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 00:02:56 ---
List_Int64([2])

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:02:59 ---
  command:
    / Sum them
    sum evenElements

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 00:02:59 ---
2

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:03:03 ---
Great! Now let me create a more concise, idiomatic q solution:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:03:04 ---
  command:
    / More concise version
    add: {sum x where (0=x mod 2) & 1=(til count x) mod 2};
    add[4 2 6 7]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 00:03:04 ---
2

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:03:06 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more cases to ensure it works correctly:

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:03:08 ---
  command:
    / Test with more cases
    add[4 88 5 54];  / indices 1 and 3: 88 (even) + 54 (even) = 142

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 00:03:08 ---
None

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:03:11 ---
  command:
    add[4 88 5 54]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 00:03:11 ---
142

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:03:12 ---
  command:
    / Test with odd numbers at odd indices
    add[1 3 5 7 9]

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 00:03:12 ---
0

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:03:15 ---
  command:
    / Test with single element
    add[enlist 5]

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 00:03:15 ---
0

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:03:18 ---
  command:
    / Test with two elements
    add[1 2]

--- 30. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #29) at 00:03:18 ---
2

--- 31. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:03:21 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 32. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 00:03:23 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_85_q_session_063c1da9/problem_solution_85.q
  content:
    add: {sum x where (0=x mod 2) & 1=(til count x) mod 2}
    

--- 33. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:03:28 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_85.q`.

The function uses a vectorized approach:
- `til count x` generates indices [0,1,2,3,...]
- `1=(til count x) mod 2` creates a boolean mask for odd indices
- `0=x mod 2` creates a boolean mask for even values
- `&` combines both conditions (even values AND odd indices)
- `where` filters the list to only matching elements
- `sum` adds them up
