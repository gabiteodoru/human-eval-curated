Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/135
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def can_arrange(arr):
    """Create a function which Return the largest index i where arr[i] < arr[i-1], or -1 if no such index exists.
    The given array will not contain duplicate values.

    Examples:
    can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5]) = 3
    can_arrange([1,2,3]) = -1
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: can_arrange

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_135.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:27:11 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- Find the largest index i where arr[i] < arr[i-1]
- Return -1 if no such index exists
- The array has no duplicate values

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 57. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:28:39 ---
Perfect! The solution is complete and tested.

**Summary:**

The `can_arrange` function finds the largest index where `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`:

1. `0N, -1_ arr` - creates a shifted version by prepending null and dropping the last element (shifts right by 1)
2. `arr < 0N, -1_ arr` - compares each element with its predecessor
3. `where` - finds all indices where the condition is true
4. `$[0=count indices; -1; last indices]` - returns -1 if no violations found, otherwise returns the largest index

The solution is vectorized, idiomatic q code that leverages native operations.
