    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n

    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, the test cases will only provide polynomials with an even number of real coefficients and non-zero leading
    coefficient, which guarantees a real root exists.

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: find_zero

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_32.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and understand the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 22:14:28 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:14:33 ---
Now let me develop the solution. I need to:
1. Implement a `poly` function that evaluates a polynomial
2. Implement `find_zero` that finds a root using numerical methods (likely Newton's method or bisection)

Let me start by implementing the `poly` function:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:14:34 ---
  command:
    poly: {[xs; x] sum xs * x xexp til count xs};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:14:34 ---

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:14:37 ---
  command:
    poly[1 2; 1f]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 22:14:37 ---

  command:
    poly[1 2; -0.5]

Good! Now I need to implement `find_zero`. I'll use Newton's method which requires the derivative. Let me implement that:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:14:43 ---
  command:
    deriv: {[xs] (1 _ til count xs) * 1 _ xs};

  command:
    deriv[1 2f]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 22:14:44 ---
List_Float64([2.0])

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:14:47 ---
  command:
    deriv[-6 11 -6 1f]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 22:14:47 ---
List_Float64([11.0, -12.0, 3.0])

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:14:49 ---
Good! Now let me implement Newton's method for finding zeros:

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:14:51 ---
  command:
    find_zero: {[xs] x: 0f; dxs: (1 _ til count xs) * 1 _ xs; i: 0; while[(i < 100) and 1e-10 < abs poly[xs; x]; x: x - poly[xs; x] % poly[dxs; x]; i+: 1]; x};

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 22:14:51 ---
None

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:14:54 ---
  command:
    find_zero[1 2f]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 22:14:54 ---
-0.5

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:14:56 ---
  command:
    find_zero[-6 11 -6 1f]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 22:14:56 ---

Perfect! Let me verify the poly function works correctly with these examples:

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:14:59 ---
  command:
    poly[1 2f; -0.5]

Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 35. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:15:15 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_32_q_session_62d44d02/problem_solution_32.q
  content:
    / Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x
    poly: {[xs; x] sum xs * x xexp til count xs};
    
    / Finds a zero of polynomial with coefficients xs using Newton's method
    find_zero: {[xs]
      x: 0f;
      dxs: (1 _ til count xs) * 1 _ xs;
      i: 0;
      while[(i < 100) and 1e-10 < abs poly[xs; x];
        x: x - poly[xs; x] % poly[dxs; x];
        i+: 1];
      x};
    

--- 36. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:15:20 ---
Done! The solution implements:

1. **`poly`**: Evaluates a polynomial using vectorized operations (`xs * x xexp til count xs`)
2. **`find_zero`**: Uses Newton's method to find a root by:
   - Starting at x=0
   - Computing the derivative coefficients
   - Iteratively refining: `x = x - f(x)/f'(x)`
   - Stopping when convergence reaches 1e-10 or after 100 iterations

The solution is idiomatic q, using vectorized operations and functional programming constructs.
