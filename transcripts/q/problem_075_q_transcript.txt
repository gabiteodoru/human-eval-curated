Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/75
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Write a function that returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers
    and false otherwise.
    Knowing that (a) is less then 100. 
    Example:
    is_multiply_prime(30) == True
    30 = 2 * 3 * 5
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: is_multiply_prime

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_75.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution.

Now let me develop the solution. I need to:
1. Create a helper function to check if a number is prime
2. Find all combinations of 3 primes whose product equals the given number
3. Return true if such a combination exists

      / We only need primes up to a, and each prime can appear multiple times
      n: count primes;
      / Check all triples (i,j,k) where i<=j<=k
      combinations: raze {[primes;i]

          {[primes;i;j;k] (primes[i]; primes[j]; primes[k])} [primes;i;j;] each (j+til (count[primes]-j))
        } [primes;i;] each (i+til (count[primes]-i))

Done! I've created a working q/kdb+ solution for HumanEval/75.

The solution:
- **`isPrime`**: Helper function that checks if a number is prime using trial division
- **`is_multiply_prime`**: Main function that generates all primes up to the input, creates all combinations of 3 primes (allowing repetition), and checks if any combination's product equals the input

Verified with test cases:
- `is_multiply_prime[30]` → `1b` (30 = 2×3×5)
- `is_multiply_prime[8]` → `1b` (8 = 2×2×2)
- `is_multiply_prime[70]` → `1b` (70 = 2×5×7)
- `is_multiply_prime[7]` → `0b` (single prime, not product of 3)
