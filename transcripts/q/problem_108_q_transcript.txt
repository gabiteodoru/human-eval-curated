Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/108
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def count_nums(arr):
    """
    Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns
    the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
    If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
    e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.
    >>> count_nums([]) == 0
    >>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1
    >>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: count_nums

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_108.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 09:46:55 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:46:59 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
1. Count elements where sum of digits > 0
2. For negative numbers, the first digit is negative (e.g., -123 → -1, 2, 3)

Let me develop the solution interactively:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:47:01 ---
  command:
    / Helper function to get sum of digits with special handling for negatives
    digitsum: {[n] $[n=0; 0; n>0; sum 10 vs n; neg[first 10 vs abs n] + sum 1_ 10 vs abs n]};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 09:47:01 ---

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:47:05 ---
  command:
    / Test the digitsum helper function
    digitsum each -123 123 -1 11 -11 0

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 09:47:05 ---
List_Int64([4, 6, -1, 2, 0, 0])

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:47:09 ---
Good! Let me verify the logic:
- -123: -1 + 2 + 3 = 4 ✓
- 123: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 ✓
- -1: -1 ✓
- 11: 1 + 1 = 2 ✓
- -11: -1 + 1 = 0 ✓

Now let me create the main function:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:47:10 ---
  command:
    count_nums: {[arr] sum digitsum[arr] > 0};

None

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:47:12 ---
Let me test the solution with the provided test cases:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:47:13 ---
  command:
    / Test case 1: empty array
    count_nums[`long$()]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 09:47:13 ---

Perfect! The solution is working correctly. Now let me write it to a file:

--- 57. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 09:49:25 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_108_q_session_dd53e4ac/problem_solution_108.q
  content:
    / Helper function to calculate sum of digits
    / For negative numbers, the first digit is negative
    digitsum: {[n] $[n=0; 0; n>0; sum 10 vs n; neg[first 10 vs abs n] + sum 1_ 10 vs abs n]};
    
    / Count elements where sum of digits > 0
    count_nums: {[arr] $[0=count arr; 0; sum (digitsum each arr) > 0]};
    

--- 58. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:49:30 ---
Solution complete! The implementation:

1. **`digitsum`**: Handles the special rule for negative numbers where the first digit is negative (e.g., -123 → -1+2+3 = 4)
2. **`count_nums`**: Counts how many elements have digit sum > 0, with explicit handling for empty arrays

All test cases pass:
- `count_nums([])` → 0
- `count_nums([-1, 11, -11])` → 1 (only 11 has digit sum > 0)
- `count_nums([1, 1, 2])` → 3 (all positive numbers have digit sum > 0)
