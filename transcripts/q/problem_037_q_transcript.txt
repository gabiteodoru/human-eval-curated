Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/37
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indices, while its values at the even indices are equal
    to the values of the even indices of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: sort_even

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_37.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:13:36 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:13:39 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- Extract values at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...)
- Sort those values
- Put sorted values back at even indices
- Keep odd indices unchanged

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:13:40 ---
  command:
    / Test data
    l1: 1 2 3;
    l2: 5 6 3 4;
    l1

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:13:40 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 3])

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:13:43 ---
  command:
    / Get even indices
    evenIdx: where 0 = (til count l2) mod 2;
    evenIdx

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:13:43 ---
List_Int64([0, 2])

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:13:43 ---
  command:
    / Get values at even indices
    l2[evenIdx]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 23:13:43 ---
List_Int64([5, 3])

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:13:45 ---
  command:
    / Sort them
    asc l2[evenIdx]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 23:13:45 ---
List_Int64([3, 5])

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:13:50 ---
  command:
    / Now put them back using indexing assignment
    result: l2;
    result[evenIdx]: asc l2[evenIdx];
    result

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 23:13:50 ---
List_Int64([3, 6, 5, 4])

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:13:52 ---
Perfect! Now let me create the function:

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:13:53 ---
  command:
    sort_even: {[l]
      evenIdx: where 0 = (til count l) mod 2;
      result: l;
      result[evenIdx]: asc l[evenIdx];
      result
     };

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:13:53 ---
None

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:13:57 ---
  command:
    / Test case 1
    sort_even[1 2 3]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 23:13:57 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 3])

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:13:59 ---
  command:
    / Test case 2
    sort_even[5 6 3 4]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 23:13:59 ---
List_Int64([3, 6, 5, 4])

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:14:02 ---
  command:
    / Test edge cases
    sort_even[enlist 5]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 23:14:02 ---
List_Int64([5])

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:14:05 ---
  command:
    / Test with empty list
    sort_even[`long$()]

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 23:14:05 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:14:09 ---
  command:
    / Test with more elements
    sort_even[9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1]

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 23:14:09 ---
List_Int64([1, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9])

--- 28. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:14:12 ---
Excellent! The function works correctly. Now let me write it to a file:

--- 29. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:14:12 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_37_q_session_8d43f477/problem_solution_37.q
  content:
    sort_even: {[l]
      evenIdx: where 0 = (til count l) mod 2;
      result: l;
      result[evenIdx]: asc l[evenIdx];
      result
     }
    

--- 30. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:14:17 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_37.q`.

The function:
- Finds even indices using `where 0 = (til count l) mod 2`
- Extracts values at those indices, sorts them with `asc`
- Uses indexed assignment to put sorted values back at even positions
- Returns the modified list with odd indices unchanged

Both test cases pass:
- `sort_even([1, 2, 3])` → `[1, 2, 3]`
- `sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])` → `[3, 6, 5, 4]`
