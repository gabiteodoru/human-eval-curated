Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/119
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def match_parens(lst):
    '''
    You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open
    parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.
    Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in
    some order, that the resulting string will be good.
    A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
    are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string
    '())' is not.
    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

    Examples:
    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: match_parens

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_119.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 08:12:00 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:12:04 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
1. Given two strings of parentheses
2. Check if concatenating them in either order results in balanced parentheses
3. Return "Yes" if possible, "No" otherwise

A string is balanced if:
- At no point while reading left-to-right does the count of ')' exceed '('
- The total count of '(' equals the total count of ')'

Let me develop a helper function to check if a string is balanced:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:12:07 ---
  command:
    / Helper function to check if parentheses are balanced
    isBalanced: {[s]
      / Convert string to +1 for '(' and -1 for ')'
      vals: $[s~"(";1;-1] each s;
      / Running sum should never go negative and should end at 0
      runningSum: sums vals;
      (0=last runningSum) and (min runningSum)>=0
      };

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 08:12:07 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:12:09 ---
  command:
    / Test the helper function
    isBalanced["(())()"]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 08:12:09 ---
False

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:12:12 ---
Let me fix the helper - I need to handle the string character by character properly:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:12:13 ---
  command:
    / Test string indexing
    s: "(())()";
    s[0]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 08:12:13 ---
Char('(')

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:12:17 ---
  command:
    / Better helper function to check if parentheses are balanced
    isBalanced: {[s]
      / Convert each character to +1 for '(' and -1 for ')'
      vals: {$[x="(";1;-1]} each s;
      / Running sum should never go negative and should end at 0
      runningSum: sums vals;
      (0=last runningSum) and (min runningSum)>=0
      };

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 08:12:17 ---
None

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:12:20 ---
  command:
    / Test the helper function
    isBalanced["(())()"]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 08:12:20 ---
True

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:12:22 ---
  command:
    isBalanced["())"]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 08:12:22 ---
False

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:12:25 ---
Great! Now let me implement the main function:

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:12:26 ---
  command:
    / Main function
    match_parens: {[lst]
      / Try both concatenation orders
      s1: lst[0],lst[1];
      s2: lst[1],lst[0];
      / Check if either is balanced
      result: isBalanced[s1] or isBalanced[s2];
      $[result;"Yes";"No"]
      };

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 08:12:26 ---
None

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:12:30 ---
  command:
    / Test with examples from the problem
    match_parens[("()("; ")")]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 08:12:30 ---
String("Yes")

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:12:33 ---

String("No")

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:12:35 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more cases to ensure correctness:

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:12:35 ---
  command:
    / Test more cases
    match_parens[("(("; "))")]

    match_parens[("((()"; ")))")]

Excellent! The solution is working correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 45. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:13:08 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_119_q_session_81cd9653/problem_solution_119.q
  content:
    / Helper function to check if parentheses are balanced
    isBalanced: {[s]
      / Convert each character to +1 for '(' and -1 for ')'
      vals: {$[x="(";1;-1]} each s;
      / Running sum should never go negative and should end at 0
      runningSum: sums vals;
      (0=last runningSum) and (min runningSum)>=0
      };
    
    / Main function
    match_parens: {[lst]
      / Try both concatenation orders
      s1: lst[0],lst[1];
      s2: lst[1],lst[0];
      / Check if either is balanced
      result: isBalanced[s1] or isBalanced[s2];
      $[result;"Yes";"No"]
      };
    

--- 46. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:13:14 ---
Perfect! I've successfully solved the problem. The solution:

1. **`isBalanced` helper function**: Checks if a string of parentheses is balanced by:
   - Converting each '(' to +1 and ')' to -1
   - Computing a running sum
   - Verifying that the running sum never goes negative (no unmatched ')' encountered) and ends at 0 (equal counts)

2. **`match_parens` main function**: 
   - Tries both concatenation orders (lst[0],lst[1] and lst[1],lst[0])
   - Returns "Yes" if either order is balanced, "No" otherwise

The solution uses native q idioms like vectorized operations (`each`), functional programming (`sums`), and conditional expressions.
