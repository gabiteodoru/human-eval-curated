Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/59
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def largest_prime_factor(n: int):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.
    >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
    29
    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
    2
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: largest_prime_factor

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_59.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

  host:
    localhost:5001

Now let me develop the solution. The problem asks for the largest prime factor of a number. My approach:
1. Find all prime factors of n
2. Return the largest one

Let me start by creating a helper function to find prime factors:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:36:44 ---
  command:
    / Helper function to find all prime factors
    prime_factors: {[n]
      factors: ();
      d: 2;
      while[n > 1;
        while[0 = n mod d;
          factors,: d;
          n: n div d
        ];
        d+: 1;
        if[d*d > n; if[n > 1; factors,: n]; n: 1]
      ];
      factors
    };

    prime_factors[13195]

    prime_factors[2048]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 23:36:49 ---
List_Int64([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2])

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:36:52 ---
Good! Now let me create the main function that returns the largest prime factor:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:36:53 ---
  command:
    largest_prime_factor: {[n]
      max prime_factors[n]
    };

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 23:36:53 ---
None

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:36:56 ---
  command:
    / Test with the provided examples
    largest_prime_factor[13195]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:36:56 ---
29

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:36:58 ---
  command:
    largest_prime_factor[2048]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:36:59 ---
2

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:37:02 ---
Perfect! Both test cases pass. However, let me refactor to make it more idiomatic and potentially more efficient by avoiding the intermediate list:

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:37:04 ---
  command:
    / More efficient version that finds the largest prime factor directly
    largest_prime_factor: {[n]
      largest: 0;
      d: 2;
      while[n > 1;
        while[0 = n mod d;
          largest: d;
          n: n div d
        ];
        d+: 1;
        if[d*d > n; if[n > 1; largest: n]; n: 1]
      ];
      largest
    };

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 23:37:04 ---
None

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:37:08 ---
  command:
    / Test the optimized version
    largest_prime_factor[13195]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 23:37:08 ---
29

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:37:11 ---
  command:
    largest_prime_factor[2048]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 23:37:11 ---
2

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:37:13 ---
Excellent! Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 26. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:37:16 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_59_q_session_8f929013/problem_solution_59.q
  content:
    largest_prime_factor: {[n]
      largest: 0;
      d: 2;
      while[n > 1;
        while[0 = n mod d;
          largest: d;
          n: n div d
        ];
        d+: 1;
        if[d*d > n; if[n > 1; largest: n]; n: 1]
      ];
      largest
    };
    

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:37:18 ---
Done! I've created the solution in `problem_solution_59.q`. 

The function works by:
1. Dividing n by each potential factor d starting from 2
2. Tracking the largest factor found
3. Optimizing by stopping when dÂ² > n (since any remaining value must be prime)
4. Both test cases pass: `largest_prime_factor[13195]` returns 29 and `largest_prime_factor[2048]` returns 2
