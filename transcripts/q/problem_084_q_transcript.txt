Problem HumanEval/84
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def solve(N):
    """Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.
    
    Example
        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".
        For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be "1100".
    
    Variables:
        @N integer
             Constraints: 0 ≤ N ≤ 10000.
    Output:
         a string of binary number
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: solve

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_84.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 00:01:37 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:01:40 ---
Now let me develop the solution. The task is to:
1. Sum the digits of the integer N
2. Convert that sum to binary
3. Return as a string

Let me start by exploring q's capabilities for this:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:01:41 ---
  command:
    / Convert number to list of digits
    string 1000

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 00:01:41 ---
String("1000")

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:01:45 ---
  command:
    / Get individual digit characters
    10 vs 1000

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 00:01:45 ---
List_Int64([1, 0, 0, 0])

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:01:44 ---
  command:
    / Sum the digits
    sum 10 vs 1000

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 00:01:44 ---
1

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:01:47 ---
  command:
    / Convert to binary
    2 vs 1

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 00:01:47 ---
List_Int64([1])

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:01:50 ---
  command:
    / Convert binary list to string
    string 2 vs 1

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 00:01:50 ---
List_Untyped([String("1")])

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:01:53 ---
  command:
    / Concatenate the string parts
    "" sv string 2 vs 1

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 00:01:53 ---
String("1")

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:01:56 ---
Great! Now let me test with the other examples:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:01:57 ---
  command:
    / Test with N=150, sum of digits = 6, binary = 110
    sum 10 vs 150

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 00:01:57 ---
6

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:02:01 ---
  command:
    "" sv string 2 vs 6

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 00:02:01 ---
String("110")

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:02:05 ---
  command:
    / Test with N=147, sum of digits = 12, binary = 1100
    sum 10 vs 147

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 00:02:05 ---
12

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:02:07 ---
  command:
    "" sv string 2 vs 12

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 00:02:07 ---
String("1100")

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:02:10 ---
Perfect! Now let me create the complete function:

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:02:11 ---
  command:
    solve: {[N] "" sv string 2 vs sum 10 vs N};

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 00:02:11 ---
None

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:02:14 ---
  command:
    solve[1000]

--- 30. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #29) at 00:02:14 ---
String("1")

--- 31. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:02:13 ---
  command:
    solve[150]

--- 32. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #31) at 00:02:13 ---
String("110")

--- 33. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:02:16 ---
  command:
    solve[147]

--- 34. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #33) at 00:02:16 ---
String("1100")

--- 35. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:02:19 ---
Excellent! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 36. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 00:02:21 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_84_q_session_b56ce6b1/problem_solution_84.q
  content:
    solve: {[N] "" sv string 2 vs sum 10 vs N};
    

--- 37. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:02:27 ---
Done! The solution is complete and written to `problem_solution_84.q`.

The q function `solve` works as follows:
- `10 vs N` converts the integer N to its base-10 digits
- `sum` adds up those digits
- `2 vs` converts the sum to binary (base-2)
- `string` converts each binary digit to a character
- `"" sv` joins them into a single string

All test cases pass:
- `solve[1000]` → `"1"`
- `solve[150]` → `"110"`
- `solve[147]` → `"1100"`
