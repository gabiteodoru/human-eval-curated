Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/62
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def derivative(xs: list):
    """ xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
     Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
    [1, 4, 12, 20]
    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 6]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: derivative

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_62.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:39:58 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:40:03 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- Given coefficients of a polynomial: xs[0] + xs[1]*x + xs[2]*x^2 + ...
- Return the derivative: xs[1] + 2*xs[2]*x + 3*xs[3]*x^2 + ...
- The derivative multiplies each coefficient by its power and reduces the power by 1

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:40:04 ---
  command:
    derivative: {1_x*til count x}

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:40:04 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:40:06 ---
  command:
    derivative[3 1 2 4 5]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:40:06 ---
List_Int64([1, 4, 12, 20])

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:40:08 ---
  command:
    derivative[1 2 3]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 23:40:09 ---
List_Int64([2, 6])

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:40:11 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few edge cases:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:40:11 ---
  command:
    derivative[5]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 23:40:11 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:40:12 ---
  command:
    derivative[`long$()]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:40:12 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:40:14 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 17. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:40:16 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_62_q_session_a98fecae/problem_solution_62.q
  content:
    derivative: {1_x*til count x}
    

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:40:22 ---
Done! The solution is complete and written to `problem_solution_62.q`.

The implementation uses pure q vectorized operations:
- `til count x` generates indices [0,1,2,...,n-1] 
- `x*til count x` multiplies each coefficient by its power
- `1_` drops the first element (constant term has derivative 0)

This matches the test cases:
- `derivative[3 1 2 4 5]` → `[1, 4, 12, 20]` ✓
- `derivative[1 2 3]` → `[2, 6]` ✓
