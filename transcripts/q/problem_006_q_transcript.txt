Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/6
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List


def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: parse_nested_parens

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_6.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 10:01:56 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:02:00 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- Parse a string with groups of parentheses separated by spaces
- For each group, find the maximum nesting depth
- Return a list of integers representing the max depth for each group

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:02:03 ---
  command:
    / Helper function to calculate max nesting depth for a single group
    maxDepth: {[s]
      / s is a string of parentheses
      / Use scan to track running depth: +1 for '(', -1 for ')'
      depths: sums ("(" = s) - ")" = s;
      max depths
     };
    
    / Test the helper
    maxDepth["(()())"]

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 10:02:03 ---
Int32(2)

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:02:05 ---
  command:
    / Test more cases
    maxDepth["((()))"]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 10:02:05 ---
Int32(3)

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:02:08 ---
  command:
    maxDepth["()"]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 10:02:08 ---
Int32(1)

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:02:11 ---
Great! Now let me implement the main function:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:02:13 ---
  command:
    parse_nested_parens: {[paren_string]
      / Split by spaces to get groups
      groups: " " vs paren_string;
      / Apply maxDepth to each group
      maxDepth each groups
     };
    
    / Test with the example
    parse_nested_parens["(()()) ((())) () ((())()())"]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 10:02:13 ---
List_Int32([2, 3, 1, 3])

--- 14. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:02:15 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly. Let me verify with a few more test cases:

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:02:16 ---
  command:
    / Test edge cases
    parse_nested_parens["()"]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 10:02:16 ---
List_Int32([1])

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:02:18 ---
  command:
    parse_nested_parens["(()()) ((()))"]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 10:02:18 ---
List_Int32([2, 3])

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:02:21 ---
Excellent! Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 20. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 10:02:25 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_6_q_session_552dd7d3/problem_solution_6.q
  content:
    / Helper function to calculate max nesting depth for a single group
    maxDepth: {[s]
      / s is a string of parentheses
      / Use scan to track running depth: +1 for '(', -1 for ')'
      depths: sums ("(" = s) - ")" = s;
      max depths
     };
    
    / Main function to parse nested parentheses
    parse_nested_parens: {[paren_string]
      / Split by spaces to get groups
      groups: " " vs paren_string;
      / Apply maxDepth to each group
      maxDepth each groups
     };
    

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:02:30 ---
Solution complete! The implementation uses:

- **Vectorized operations**: `sums` to calculate running depth instead of loops
- **Native q string operations**: `vs` for splitting by spaces
- **Functional approach**: `each` to map the helper function over groups
- **Boolean arithmetic**: `("(" = s) - ")" = s` to efficiently calculate depth changes

The solution correctly handles the example case `(()()) ((())) () ((())()())` â†’ `[2, 3, 1, 3]`.
