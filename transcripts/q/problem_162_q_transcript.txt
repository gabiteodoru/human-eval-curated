Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/162
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def string_to_md5(text):
    """
    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.
    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.

    >>> string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: string_to_md5

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_162.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll help you solve this HumanEval problem by implementing an MD5 hash function in q/kdb+. Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:46:25 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:46:28 ---
Now let me explore how to compute MD5 hashes in q/kdb+. The standard approach is to use the `.Q.hap` function for hashing or call out to the system.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:46:29 ---
  command:
    / Check if we can use md5sum utility
    system "echo 'Hello world' | md5sum"

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:46:29 ---
List_Untyped([String("f0ef7081e1539ac00ef5b761b4fb01b3  -")])

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:46:32 ---
Good! The md5sum utility is available. Let me develop a function that uses it properly:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:46:33 ---
  command:
    / Test md5 with proper string
    test: "Hello world";
    result: system "echo -n 'Hello world' | md5sum";
    result

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 07:46:33 ---
List_Untyped([String("3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62  -")])

--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:46:37 ---
Perfect! Now I need to extract just the hash part (before the space). Let me develop the complete function:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:46:39 ---
  command:
    string_to_md5: {[text]
      if[0=count text; :()];
      cmd: "echo -n '", text, "' | md5sum";
      result: first system cmd;
      first " " vs result
      };
    string_to_md5["Hello world"]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 07:46:39 ---
String("3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62")

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:46:42 ---
Excellent! Now let me test with the empty string case:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:46:42 ---
  command:
    string_to_md5[""]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 07:46:42 ---
List_Untyped([])

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:46:46 ---
Good! It returns an empty list (equivalent to None/null) for empty strings. However, I need to handle special characters that might cause issues with shell commands. Let me improve the solution:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:46:47 ---
  command:
    / Test with special characters that might break shell
    string_to_md5["test'quote"]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 07:46:47 ---

  result: first system cmd;
                ^

  [3]  / Test with special characters that might break shell
string_to_md5["test'quote"]

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:46:51 ---
I need to handle special characters properly. Let me use a different approach with printf or by escaping:

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:46:52 ---
  command:
    / Try using printf to handle special characters
    text: "test'quote";
    cmd: "printf '%s' '", (ssr[text;"'";"'\\''"]),"' | md5sum";
    cmd

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 07:46:52 ---
String("printf '%s' 'test'\''quote' | md5sum")

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:46:55 ---
  command:
    result: first system cmd;
    first " " vs result

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:46:58 ---
Good! Now let me create the complete function with proper escaping:

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:47:00 ---
  command:
    string_to_md5: {[text]
      if[0=count text; :()];
      escaped: ssr[text;"'";"'\\''"];
      cmd: "printf '%s' '", escaped, "' | md5sum";
      result: first system cmd;
      first " " vs result
      };
    string_to_md5["Hello world"]

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 07:47:00 ---

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:47:03 ---
  command:
    / Test edge cases
    string_to_md5[""]

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 07:47:03 ---
List_Untyped([])

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:47:05 ---

    / Test with other special characters
    string_to_md5["test$variable"]

String("50718ad58f8cd8d8151eed3b82a1e135")

--- 33. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:47:12 ---
  command:
    / Verify the main test case
    string_to_md5["Hello world"]

--- 34. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #33) at 07:47:12 ---
String("3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62")

--- 35. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:47:15 ---
Perfect! The function works correctly. Now let me write it to the solution file:

--- 36. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:47:17 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_162_q_session_6e726d5e/problem_solution_162.q
  content:

      if[0=count text; :()];
      escaped: ssr[text;"'";"'\\''"];
      cmd: "printf '%s' '", escaped, "' | md5sum";
      result: first system cmd;
      first " " vs result
      };
    

--- 37. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:47:22 ---
Solution complete! The `string_to_md5` function:
- Returns an empty list `()` (q's null) for empty strings
- Uses `printf` with proper shell escaping to handle special characters (like quotes)
- Calls the system `md5sum` utility and extracts the hash portion
- Returns the MD5 hash as a string for non-empty inputs
