Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/153
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    """You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
    The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
    letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
    in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
    choose the one that comes first in the list.
    For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
    extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
    return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
    (its strength is -1).
    Example:
    for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: Strongest_Extension

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_153.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 10:02:42 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:02:45 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- Calculate strength for each extension: (uppercase count) - (lowercase count)
- Find the strongest extension (maximum strength)
- If tied, choose the first one
- Return "ClassName.ExtensionName"

Let me develop the solution step by step:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:02:46 ---
  command:
    / Helper to count uppercase letters
    countUpper: {sum x within "AZ"};
    countUpper "SErviNGSliCes"

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 10:02:46 ---
Int32(6)

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:02:49 ---
  command:
    / Helper to count lowercase letters
    countLower: {sum x within "az"};
    countLower "SErviNGSliCes"

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 10:02:49 ---
Int32(7)

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:02:52 ---
  command:
    / Calculate strength: uppercase - lowercase
    calcStrength: {(sum x within "AZ") - sum x within "az"};
    calcStrength "SErviNGSliCes"

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 10:02:52 ---
Int32(-1)

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:02:54 ---
Good! Now let me build the complete function:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:02:57 ---
  command:
    Strongest_Extension: {[class_name; extensions]
      strengths: (sum each extensions within\: "AZ") - sum each extensions within\: "az";
      strongest_idx: strengths?max strengths;
      class_name, ".", extensions[strongest_idx]
     };
    Strongest_Extension["Slices"; ("SErviNGSliCes"; "Cheese"; "StuFfed")]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 10:02:57 ---
String("Slices.SErviNGSliCes")

--- 14. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:03:00 ---
Perfect! Let me test with the other example:

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:03:00 ---
  command:
    Strongest_Extension["my_class"; ("AA"; "Be"; "CC")]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 10:03:00 ---
String("my_class.AA")

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:03:03 ---
Excellent! Let me verify the strengths to make sure the logic is correct:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:03:04 ---
  command:
    / Verify strengths for each extension in the second example
    extensions: ("AA"; "Be"; "CC");
    strengths: (sum each extensions within\: "AZ") - sum each extensions within\: "az";
    strengths

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 10:03:04 ---
List_Int32([2, 0, 2])

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:03:07 ---
Perfect! "AA" and "CC" both have strength 2, but "AA" comes first, so it's correctly selected. Let me test with the first example too:

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:03:08 ---
  command:
    / Verify first example
    extensions: ("SErviNGSliCes"; "Cheese"; "StuFfed");
    strengths: (sum each extensions within\: "AZ") - sum each extensions within\: "az";
    strengths

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 10:03:08 ---
List_Int32([-1, -4, -3])

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:03:11 ---
Great! "SErviNGSliCes" has strength -1, which is the maximum (least negative), so it's correctly selected.

Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 24. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 10:03:13 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_153_q_session_5616f006/problem_solution_153.q
  content:
    Strongest_Extension: {[class_name; extensions]
      strengths: (sum each extensions within\: "AZ") - sum each extensions within\: "az";
      strongest_idx: strengths?max strengths;
      class_name, ".", extensions[strongest_idx]
     }
    

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:03:17 ---
Solution complete! The function uses vectorized operations to:
1. Calculate strength for each extension: `(uppercase count) - (lowercase count)` 
2. Find the index of the maximum strength using `?` (find first occurrence)
3. Return the formatted string with the strongest extension
