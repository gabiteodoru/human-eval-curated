Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/55
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def fib(n: int):
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number.
    >>> fib(10)
    55
    >>> fib(1)
    1
    >>> fib(8)
    21
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: fib

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_55.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this Fibonacci problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:32:39 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:32:43 ---
Now let me develop and test the Fibonacci function. In q, we can use scan (`\`) to generate the Fibonacci sequence iteratively:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:32:44 ---
  command:
    fib: {[n] last (n-1) {x,sum -2#x}/ 1 1};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:32:44 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:32:47 ---
  command:
    fib[10]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:32:47 ---
89

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:32:50 ---
Hmm, that's returning 89 instead of 55. Let me check the indexing - the problem might be 0-indexed vs 1-indexed:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:32:51 ---
  command:
    (10-1) {x,sum -2#x}/ 1 1

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:32:51 ---
List_Int64([1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89])

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:32:51 ---
I see! The sequence is 0-indexed in the Python version. Let me check what fib(1) should return:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:32:51 ---
  command:
    fib[1]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 23:32:51 ---
1

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:32:55 ---
  command:
    fib[8]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 23:32:55 ---
34

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:32:58 ---
The issue is clear. Looking at the sequence generated, position 10 should be 55, position 8 should be 21. Let me trace through the expected values:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:32:59 ---
  command:
    10 {x,sum -2#x}/ 1 1

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 23:32:59 ---
List_Int64([1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144])

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:33:03 ---
So index 10 is 89. But the test expects 55. Let me check if this is 0-indexed Fibonacci where fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1:

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:33:03 ---
  command:
    10 {x,sum -2#x}/ 0 1

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 23:33:03 ---
List_Int64([0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89])

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:33:06 ---
Perfect! With `0 1` as the starting values, index 10 is 55 and index 8 is 21. Now let me update the function:

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:33:07 ---
  command:
    fib: {[n] last n {x,sum -2#x}/ 0 1};

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 23:33:07 ---
None

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:33:09 ---
  command:
    fib[10]

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 23:33:09 ---
89

--- 28. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:33:12 ---
I'm getting 89 again. Let me check the sequence more carefully:

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:33:13 ---
  command:
    (n {x,sum -2#x}/ 0 1)[n:10]

--- 30. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #29) at 23:33:13 ---
55

--- 31. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:33:16 ---
Ah! I need to index into the sequence at position `n`, not take the last element. Let me verify:

--- 32. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:33:17 ---
  command:
    (8 {x,sum -2#x}/ 0 1)[8]

--- 33. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #32) at 23:33:17 ---
21

--- 34. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:33:20 ---
  command:
    (1 {x,sum -2#x}/ 0 1)[1]

--- 35. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #34) at 23:33:20 ---
1

--- 36. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:33:19 ---
Perfect! Now let me update the function:

--- 37. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:33:20 ---
  command:
    fib: {[n] (n {x,sum -2#x}/ 0 1)[n]};

--- 38. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #37) at 23:33:20 ---
None

--- 39. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:33:23 ---
  command:
    fib[10]

--- 40. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #39) at 23:33:23 ---
55

--- 41. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:33:26 ---
  command:
    fib[1]

--- 42. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #41) at 23:33:26 ---
1

--- 43. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:33:28 ---
  command:
    fib[8]

--- 44. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #43) at 23:33:28 ---
21

--- 45. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:33:31 ---
Perfect! All tests pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 46. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:33:34 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_55_q_session_8ee27a71/problem_solution_55.q
  content:
    fib: {[n] (n {x,sum -2#x}/ 0 1)[n]};
    

--- 47. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:33:37 ---
Done! The solution uses q's scan operator (`/`) to iteratively build the Fibonacci sequence starting from `0 1`, then indexes into position `n` to get the n-th Fibonacci number.
