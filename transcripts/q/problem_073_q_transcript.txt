Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/73
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: smallest_change

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_73.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:49:46 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

Now let me analyze the problem:
- We need to find the minimum number of changes to make an array palindromic
- A palindromic array reads the same forwards and backwards
- We need to compare elements from the start and end, working towards the center

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:49:53 ---
  command:
    smallest_change: {[arr] sum arr <> reverse arr};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:49:53 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:49:57 ---
Wait, that approach counts all mismatches, but we only need to count half of them (since fixing one position fixes its mirror position). Let me reconsider:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:49:58 ---
  command:
    smallest_change: {[arr] n: count arr; sum arr[til floor n%2] <> arr[reverse til floor n%2]};

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:49:58 ---
None

--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:50:01 ---
Actually, a simpler approach: compare the first half with the reversed second half. Let me test with the examples:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:49:58 ---
  command:
    smallest_change[1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 23:49:59 ---
Int32(4)

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:50:02 ---
  command:
    smallest_change[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 23:50:02 ---
Int32(2)

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:50:05 ---
That's not correct - should be 1. Let me reconsider the logic. I need to compare each position with its mirror position from the end:

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:50:06 ---
  command:
    smallest_change: {[arr] n: count arr; sum arr[til floor n%2] <> reverse[arr][til floor n%2]};

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:50:06 ---
None

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:50:08 ---
  command:
    smallest_change[1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 23:50:08 ---
Int32(4)

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:50:12 ---
  command:
    smallest_change[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 23:50:13 ---
Int32(1)

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:50:15 ---
  command:
    smallest_change[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 23:50:15 ---

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:50:18 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me verify the logic once more and test edge cases:

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:50:18 ---
  command:
    smallest_change[1]

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 23:50:18 ---

Great! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 34. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:50:29 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_73_q_session_e11dc192/problem_solution_73.q
  content:
    smallest_change: {[arr] n: count arr; sum arr[til floor n%2] <> reverse[arr][til floor n%2]};
    

--- 35. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:50:33 ---
Solution complete! The function `smallest_change` works by:
1. Comparing the first half of the array with the corresponding positions in the reversed array
2. Counting mismatches - each mismatch requires one change to make the array palindromic
3. Using vectorized comparison (`<>`) and `sum` for efficient computation
