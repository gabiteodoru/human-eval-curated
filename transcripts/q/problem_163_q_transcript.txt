Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/163
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def generate_integers(a, b):
    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the single-digit even numbers in the
    closed interval [min(a,b), max(a,b)] (including endpoints), in ascending order.

    For example:
    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(10, 14) => []
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: generate_integers

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_163.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:47:33 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:47:37 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. The function needs to:
1. Find the min and max of the two inputs
2. Get all single-digit even numbers in that range
3. Return them in ascending order

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:47:39 ---
  command:
    generate_integers: {[a;b] lower: a & b; upper: a | b; evenDigits: 2 4 6 8; evenDigits where (evenDigits >= lower) & (evenDigits <= upper)};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:47:39 ---
Error: assign

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:47:42 ---
Let me fix the syntax - I need to use local variables properly:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:47:42 ---
  command:
    generate_integers: {[a;b] evenDigits: 2 4 6 8; evenDigits where (evenDigits >= a & b) & (evenDigits <= a | b)};

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 07:47:42 ---
None

--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:47:45 ---
Good! Now let me test it with the examples:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:47:45 ---
  command:
    generate_integers[2; 8]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 07:47:45 ---
List_Int64([2, 4, 6, 8])

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:47:48 ---
  command:
    generate_integers[8; 2]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 07:47:48 ---
List_Int64([2, 4, 6, 8])

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:47:51 ---
  command:
    generate_integers[10; 14]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 07:47:51 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:47:54 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me test a few edge cases:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:47:55 ---
  command:
    generate_integers[1; 1]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 07:47:55 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:47:58 ---
  command:
    generate_integers[4; 4]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 07:47:58 ---
List_Int64([4])

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:48:00 ---
  command:
    generate_integers[0; 9]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 07:48:00 ---
List_Int64([2, 4, 6, 8])

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:48:02 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 25. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:48:05 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_163_q_session_298a7f6d/problem_solution_163.q
  content:
    generate_integers: {[a;b] evenDigits: 2 4 6 8; evenDigits where (evenDigits >= a & b) & (evenDigits <= a | b)};
    

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:48:10 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_163.q`.

The implementation uses idiomatic q:
- `a & b` for min(a,b)
- `a | b` for max(a,b)  
- `evenDigits: 2 4 6 8` defines single-digit even numbers
- `where` filters the list based on the range condition
- Fully vectorized, no loops needed
