Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/96
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    for example:
    count_up_to(5) => [2,3]
    count_up_to(11) => [2,3,5,7]
    count_up_to(0) => []
    count_up_to(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
    count_up_to(1) => []
    count_up_to(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: count_up_to

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_96.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:50:42 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:50:45 ---
Now let me develop a solution. The task is to find all prime numbers less than n. I'll use a vectorized approach:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:50:47 ---
  command:
    / Helper function to check if a number is prime
    isPrime: {[x] $[x<2; 0b; not any 0=x mod 2_til ceiling sqrt x]};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:50:47 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:50:50 ---
  command:
    / Main function to count up to n
    count_up_to: {[n] where isPrime each til n};

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 07:50:50 ---
None

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:50:52 ---
Now let me test it with the provided examples:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:50:52 ---
  command:
    count_up_to[5]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 07:50:52 ---
List_Int64([2, 3, 4])

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:50:55 ---
I see there's an issue with my isPrime function - it's including 4 as prime. Let me fix this:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:50:56 ---
  command:
    isPrime[4]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 07:50:56 ---
True

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:50:58 ---
  command:
    2_til ceiling sqrt 4

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 07:50:58 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:51:02 ---
I see the issue - when we drop 2 elements from an empty or small list, we get an empty list, so there are no divisors to check. Let me fix the isPrime function:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:51:04 ---
  command:
    isPrime: {[x] $[x<2; 0b; x=2; 1b; 0=x mod 2; 0b; not any 0=x mod 3_til[x] where 1=3_til[x] mod 2]};

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 07:51:04 ---
None

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:51:07 ---
  command:
    isPrime each til 20

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 07:51:07 ---
List_Bool([False, False, True, True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False, True])

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:51:10 ---
That's still wrong - it's marking too many numbers as prime. Let me use a simpler, clearer approach:

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:51:12 ---
  command:
    isPrime: {[x] $[x<2; 0b; x in 2 3; 1b; not any 0=x mod 2_til 1+floor sqrt x]};

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 07:51:12 ---
None

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:51:14 ---
  command:
    isPrime each til 20

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 07:51:14 ---
List_Bool([False, False, True, True, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True, False, True])

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:51:17 ---
Good! Now let me test the count_up_to function with all the examples:

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:51:17 ---
  command:
    count_up_to[5]

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 07:51:17 ---
List_Int64([2, 3])

--- 30. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:51:20 ---
  command:
    count_up_to[11]

--- 31. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #30) at 07:51:20 ---
List_Int64([2, 3, 5, 7])

--- 32. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:51:22 ---
  command:
    count_up_to[0]

--- 33. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #32) at 07:51:22 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 34. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:51:24 ---
  command:
    count_up_to[20]

--- 35. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #34) at 07:51:24 ---
List_Int64([2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19])

--- 36. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:51:27 ---
  command:
    count_up_to[1]

--- 37. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #36) at 07:51:27 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 38. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:51:29 ---
  command:
    count_up_to[18]

--- 39. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #38) at 07:51:29 ---
List_Int64([2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17])

--- 40. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:51:32 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to a file:

--- 41. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:51:37 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_96_q_session_834ca294/problem_solution_96.q
  content:
    / Helper function to check if a number is prime
    isPrime: {[x] $[x<2; 0b; x in 2 3; 1b; not any 0=x mod 2_til 1+floor sqrt x]};
    
    / Main function to count up to n
    count_up_to: {[n] where isPrime each til n};
    

--- 42. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:51:40 ---
Solution complete! The implementation:

- **isPrime** helper function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 to sqrt(x)
- **count_up_to** uses `where isPrime each til n` to filter primes less than n
- All test cases pass correctly
