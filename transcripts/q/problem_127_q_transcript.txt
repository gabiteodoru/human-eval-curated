Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/127
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """You are given two intervals,
    where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
    includes both start and end.
    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
    intervals is a prime number.
    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
    otherwise, return "NO".
    If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".


    [input/output] samples:
    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
    """

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: intersection

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_127.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 08:18:55 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:18:59 ---
Now let me break down the problem:
1. Find the intersection of two intervals
2. Calculate the length of the intersection
3. Check if the length is a prime number
4. Return "YES" if prime, "NO" otherwise

Let me start by developing helper functions:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:19:01 ---
  command:
    / Helper function to check if a number is prime
    isPrime: {[n]
      if[n<2; :0b];
      if[n=2; :1b];
      if[0=n mod 2; :0b];
      all n mod 2+til floor sqrt n
      };

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 08:19:02 ---

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:19:04 ---
  command:
    / Test the isPrime function
    isPrime each 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

List_Bool([False, False, True, True, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True])

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:19:07 ---
Good! Now let me implement the main intersection function:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:19:10 ---
  command:
    / Main intersection function
    intersection: {[interval1; interval2]
      / Find the intersection bounds
      start: max (interval1[0]; interval2[0]);
      end: min (interval1[1]; interval2[1]);
      
      / Check if intervals intersect
      if[start > end; :"NO"];
      
      / Calculate length of intersection (inclusive)
      len: 1 + end - start;
      
      / Return YES if length is prime, otherwise NO
      $[isPrime[len]; "YES"; "NO"]
      };

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 08:19:10 ---
None

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:19:12 ---
Now let me test the function with the provided examples:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:19:13 ---
  command:
    / Test case 1: intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
    intersection[(1 2); (2 3)]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 08:19:13 ---
String("NO")

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:19:16 ---
  command:
    / Test case 2: intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
    intersection[(-1 1); (0 4)]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 08:19:16 ---
String("YES")

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:19:19 ---
Wait, that should be "NO". Let me check the intersection:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:19:20 ---
  command:
    / Check intersection of (-1, 1) and (0, 4)
    start: max (-1; 0);
    end: min (1; 4);
    len: 1 + end - start;
    (start; end; len; isPrime[len])

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 08:19:20 ---
List_Untyped([0, 1, 2, True])

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:19:25 ---
Ah, the intersection is [0,1] which has length 2 (inclusive), and 2 is prime. But the expected output is "NO". Let me re-read the problem... The intersection length is 1 according to the problem description for (1,3) and (2,4) which gives (2,3).

Let me recalculate:

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:19:26 ---
  command:
    / Check the example from problem description: (1,3) and (2,4) => (2,3) with length 1
    start: max (1; 2);
    end: min (3; 4);
    len: 1 + end - start;
    (start; end; len)

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 08:19:26 ---
List_Int64([2, 3, 2])

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:19:30 ---
I see the issue - with my formula (1 + end - start), I get length 2 for interval (2,3), but the problem says the length should be 1. The "length" here means the span, not the count of integers. So the length should be `end - start`:

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:19:34 ---
  command:
    / Corrected intersection function
    intersection: {[interval1; interval2]
      / Find the intersection bounds
      start: max (interval1[0]; interval2[0]);
      end: min (interval1[1]; interval2[1]);
      
      / Check if intervals intersect
      if[start > end; :"NO"];
      
      / Calculate length of intersection (span, not count)
      len: end - start;
      
      / Return YES if length is prime, otherwise NO
      $[isPrime[len]; "YES"; "NO"]
      };

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 08:19:34 ---
None

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:19:37 ---
  command:
    / Test case 1: intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
    intersection[(1 2); (2 3)]

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 08:19:37 ---
String("NO")

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:19:40 ---
  command:
    / Test case 2: intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
    intersection[(-1 1); (0 4)]

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 08:19:41 ---
String("NO")

--- 30. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:19:43 ---
  command:
    / Test case 3: intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
    intersection[(-3 -1); (-5 5)]

--- 31. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #30) at 08:19:43 ---
String("YES")

--- 32. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:19:47 ---
Perfect! Let me verify the logic for test case 3:

--- 33. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:19:47 ---
  command:
    / Verify test case 3
    start: max (-3; -5);
    end: min (-1; 5);
    len: end - start;
    (start; end; len; isPrime[len])

--- 34. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #33) at 08:19:47 ---
List_Untyped([-3, -1, 2, True])

--- 35. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:19:50 ---
Excellent! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to a file:

--- 36. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:19:55 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_127_q_session_a949e313/problem_solution_127.q
  content:
    / Helper function to check if a number is prime
    isPrime: {[n]
      if[n<2; :0b];
      if[n=2; :1b];
      if[0=n mod 2; :0b];
      all n mod 2+til floor sqrt n
      };
    
    / Main intersection function
    intersection: {[interval1; interval2]
      / Find the intersection bounds
      start: max (interval1[0]; interval2[0]);
      end: min (interval1[1]; interval2[1]);
    
      / Check if intervals intersect
      if[start > end; :"NO"];
    
      / Calculate length of intersection (span, not count)
      len: end - start;
    
      / Return YES if length is prime, otherwise NO
      $[isPrime[len]; "YES"; "NO"]
      };
    

--- 37. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:19:59 ---
Solution completed! The q/kdb+ implementation:

- Uses a helper function `isPrime` to check primality efficiently
- Finds intersection bounds using `max` for start and `min` for end
- Calculates intersection length as the span (end - start)
- Returns "YES" if the length is prime, "NO" otherwise

All test cases pass correctly.
