Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/34
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: unique

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_34.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:11:34 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

Now let me develop and test the solution. The problem is straightforward: return sorted unique elements from a list.

In q/kdb+, this is very simple:
- `distinct` removes duplicates
- `asc` sorts in ascending order

Let me test this approach:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:11:38 ---
  command:
    unique: {asc distinct x};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:11:38 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:11:41 ---
  command:
    unique[5 3 5 2 3 3 9 0 123]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:11:41 ---
List_Int64([0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123])

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:11:44 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more cases to make sure it works correctly:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:11:45 ---
  command:
    unique[1 1 1 1]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:11:45 ---
List_Int64([1])

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:11:45 ---
  command:
    unique[()]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 23:11:45 ---
List_Untyped([])

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:11:48 ---
  command:
    unique[10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:11:48 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:11:51 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 17. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:11:53 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_34_q_session_9cfbd328/problem_solution_34.q
  content:
    unique: {asc distinct x}
    

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:11:58 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_34.q`.

The implementation is very concise and idiomatic q:
- `distinct x` removes duplicate elements
- `asc` sorts the result in ascending order

This matches the expected behavior from the Python reference, returning `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]` for the input `[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`.
