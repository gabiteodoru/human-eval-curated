Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/114
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def minSubArraySum(nums):
    """
    Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array
    of nums.
    Example
    minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]) == 1
    minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]) == -6
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: minSubArraySum

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_114.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

Now let me understand the problem: I need to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array. This is a classic problem that can be solved using Kadane's algorithm (modified for minimum instead of maximum).

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:07:06 ---
  command:
    / Test with the examples first to understand the problem
    nums1: 2 3 4 1 2 4;
    nums2: -1 -2 -3;
    / For nums1, the minimum subarray is [1] with sum 1
    / For nums2, the minimum subarray is [-1,-2,-3] with sum -6
    nums1

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 08:07:06 ---
List_Int64([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4])

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:07:12 ---
  command:
    / Modified Kadane's algorithm for minimum sum
    / We track the minimum sum ending at each position
    minSubArraySum: {[nums]
      minEndingHere: nums[0];
      minSoFar: nums[0];
      i: 1;
      while[i < count nums;
        minEndingHere: min(nums[i]; minEndingHere + nums[i]);
        minSoFar: min(minSoFar; minEndingHere);
        i: i + 1
      ];
      minSoFar
     };
    minSubArraySum[2 3 4 1 2 4]

Good! But I should make this more idiomatic using q's vectorized operations. Let me create a better version:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:07:19 ---
  command:
    / More idiomatic q version using scan
    minSubArraySum: {[nums]
      / Use scan to compute minimum sum ending at each position
      / At each position: min(current element, previous min sum + current element)
      minEnding: {min(x;y)}\[nums];
      min minEnding
     };
    minSubArraySum[2 3 4 1 2 4]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 08:07:19 ---

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:07:22 ---
  command:
    minSubArraySum[-1 -2 -3]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 08:07:22 ---

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:07:24 ---
That's not correct. The issue is with my scan approach. Let me fix it:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:07:26 ---
  command:
    / Correct vectorized version
    minSubArraySum: {[nums]
      / At each position, track min sum ending at that position
      / minEnding[i] = min(nums[i], minEnding[i-1] + nums[i])
      minEnding: {min(y; x+y)}\[nums];
      min minEnding
     };
    minSubArraySum[2 3 4 1 2 4]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 08:07:26 ---
1

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:07:28 ---
  command:
    minSubArraySum[-1 -2 -3]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 08:07:28 ---
-6

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:07:31 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more edge cases:

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:07:31 ---
  command:
    / Test single element
    minSubArraySum[enlist 5]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 08:07:31 ---
5

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:07:34 ---
  command:
    / Test mixed positive and negative
    minSubArraySum[5 -3 2 -1 4]

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 08:07:34 ---
-3

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:07:37 ---
  command:
    / Test all positive
    minSubArraySum[1 2 3 4 5]

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 08:07:37 ---
1

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:07:39 ---
  command:
    / Test with negative then positive
    minSubArraySum[-5 10 -3 2]

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 08:07:39 ---
-5

--- 30. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:07:46 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 31. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:07:50 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_114_q_session_92f4667e/problem_solution_114.q
  content:
    minSubArraySum: {[nums]
      / Modified Kadane's algorithm for minimum subarray sum
      / At each position, track minimum sum ending at that position
      / minEnding[i] = min(nums[i], minEnding[i-1] + nums[i])
      minEnding: {min(y; x+y)}\[nums];
      min minEnding
     }
    

--- 32. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:07:53 ---
Done! The solution uses a vectorized implementation of Kadane's algorithm (modified for minimum instead of maximum). The scan operator `\` computes the minimum sum ending at each position, then we take the minimum of all those values.
