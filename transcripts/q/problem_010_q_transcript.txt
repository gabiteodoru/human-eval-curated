Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/10
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]


def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: make_palindrome

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_10.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 09:53:01 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:53:05 ---
Now let me develop the solution. First, I'll implement the `is_palindrome` helper function:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:05 ---
  command:
    is_palindrome: {x~reverse x};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 09:53:05 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:08 ---
  command:
    is_palindrome[""]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 09:53:08 ---
True

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:10 ---
  command:
    is_palindrome["aba"]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 09:53:10 ---
True

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:13 ---
  command:
    is_palindrome["abc"]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 09:53:13 ---
False

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:53:17 ---
Good! Now let me implement the `make_palindrome` function. The algorithm is:
1. Find the longest postfix (suffix) that is a palindrome
2. Take the prefix before that suffix and reverse it
3. Append the reversed prefix to the end of the original string

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:21 ---
  command:
    make_palindrome: {[s] if[0=count s; :s]; i:first where {is_palindrome[x]} each (neg til 1+count s) sublist\: s; prefix:(i-1) sublist s; s,reverse prefix};

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 09:53:21 ---
None

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:53:24 ---
Let me test this with the provided examples:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:24 ---
  command:
    make_palindrome[""]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 09:53:24 ---
String("")

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:27 ---
  command:
    make_palindrome["cat"]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 09:53:27 ---
String("catt")

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:53:31 ---
That's not right. Let me reconsider the algorithm. I need to find the longest **postfix** (suffix) that is a palindrome, starting from the end. Let me trace through "cat":
- Check if "cat" is palindrome: no
- Check if "at" is palindrome: no  
- Check if "t" is palindrome: yes
- So the palindromic suffix is "t", prefix is "ca"
- Result should be "cat" + reverse("ca") = "catac"

Let me fix my approach:

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:32 ---
  command:
    make_palindrome: {[s] if[0=count s; :s]; i:first where {is_palindrome[x]} each (neg til 1+count s) sublist\: s; prefix:i sublist s; s,reverse prefix};

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 09:53:32 ---
None

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:34 ---
  command:
    make_palindrome["cat"]

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 09:53:34 ---
String("cat")

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:53:36 ---
Let me debug this step by step to understand what's happening:

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:37 ---
  command:
    s:"cat"; (neg til 1+count s) sublist\: s

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 09:53:37 ---
List_Untyped([String(""), String("t"), String("at"), String("cat")])

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:40 ---
  command:
    s:"cat"; {is_palindrome[x]} each (neg til 1+count s) sublist\: s

--- 30. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #29) at 09:53:40 ---
List_Bool([True, True, False, False])

--- 31. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:44 ---
  command:
    s:"cat"; i:first where {is_palindrome[x]} each (neg til 1+count s) sublist\: s; i

--- 32. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #31) at 09:53:44 ---
0

--- 33. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:53:47 ---
I see the issue! The `first where` is giving me index 0 (empty string is a palindrome). I need to find suffixes in the right order. Let me reconsider: I should check from longest suffix to shortest, and take the first one that's a palindrome:

--- 34. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:48 ---
  command:
    s:"cat"; (til 1+count s) sublist\: s

--- 35. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #34) at 09:53:48 ---
List_Untyped([String(""), String("c"), String("ca"), String("cat")])

--- 36. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:53:50 ---
Let me think about this differently. I need to generate all suffixes and check which ones are palindromes:

--- 37. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:51 ---
  command:
    s:"cat"; (til 1+count s) _ \: s

--- 38. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #37) at 09:53:51 ---
List_Untyped([String("cat"), String("at"), String("t"), String("")])

--- 39. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:53:53 ---
Perfect! Now let me check which are palindromes:

--- 40. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:53 ---
  command:
    s:"cat"; {is_palindrome[x]} each (til 1+count s) _ \: s

--- 41. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #40) at 09:53:54 ---
List_Bool([False, False, True, True])

--- 42. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:53:56 ---
  command:
    s:"cat"; i:first where {is_palindrome[x]} each (til 1+count s) _ \: s; i

--- 43. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #42) at 09:53:57 ---
2

--- 44. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:54:00 ---
Good! So index 2 means the suffix starting at position 2 is "t" (a palindrome). The prefix before that is "ca" (positions 0-1). Let me update the function:

--- 45. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:54:02 ---
  command:
    make_palindrome: {[s] if[0=count s; :s]; i:first where {is_palindrome[x]} each (til 1+count s) _ \: s; prefix:i sublist s; s,reverse prefix};

--- 46. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #45) at 09:54:02 ---
None

--- 47. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:54:04 ---
  command:
    make_palindrome["cat"]

--- 48. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #47) at 09:54:04 ---
String("catac")

--- 49. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:54:07 ---
Excellent! Let me test the other examples:

--- 50. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:54:08 ---
  command:
    make_palindrome[""]

--- 51. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #50) at 09:54:08 ---
String("")

--- 52. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:54:10 ---
  command:
    make_palindrome["cata"]

--- 53. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #52) at 09:54:10 ---
String("catac")

--- 54. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:54:13 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me verify a few more edge cases:

--- 55. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:54:14 ---
  command:
    make_palindrome["x"]

--- 56. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #55) at 09:54:14 ---

--- 69. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:54:29 ---
Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. The issue is that `"x"` is an atom, not a list. Let me check what worked before:

--- 70. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:54:29 ---
  command:
    s:"cat"; type s

--- 71. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #70) at 09:54:29 ---

--- 74. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:54:37 ---
Ah! `"x"` is a char atom (type -10), while `"cat"` is a char list (type 10). I need to handle both. Let me update the function to ensure we're working with a list:
