Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/106
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def f(n):
    """ Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:
    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: f

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_106.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 08:01:19 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:01:23 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- For indices 1 to n, if index i is even, return factorial(i)
- If index i is odd, return sum of numbers from 1 to i
- Example: f(5) = [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
  - i=1 (odd): sum 1 to 1 = 1
  - i=2 (even): 2! = 2
  - i=3 (odd): sum 1 to 3 = 6
  - i=4 (even): 4! = 24
  - i=5 (odd): sum 1 to 5 = 15

Let me develop the solution using q tools:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:01:24 ---
  command:
    / Helper functions for factorial and sum
    factorial: {prd 1+til x};
    sumTo: {sum 1+til x};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 08:01:24 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:01:27 ---
  command:
    / Test helper functions
    factorial 4

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 08:01:27 ---

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:01:29 ---
  command:
    sumTo 5

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 08:01:29 ---

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:01:32 ---
Good! Now let me create the main function using vectorized operations:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:01:34 ---
  command:
    / Main function - vectorized approach
    f: {[n] 
      indices: 1+til n;
      isEven: 0=indices mod 2;
      factorials: prd each 1+til each indices;
      sums: sum each 1+til each indices;
      ?[isEven; factorials; sums]
     };

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 08:01:34 ---
Error: assign
Trace:
  [3]  
  factorials: prd each 1+til each indices;
  sums: sum each 1+til each indices;
      ^
  ?[isEven; factorials; sums]


--- 14. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:01:37 ---
Let me fix the syntax error - I need semicolons between statements:

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:01:37 ---
  command:
    f: {[n] 
      indices: 1+til n;
      isEven: 0=indices mod 2;
      factorials: prd each 1+til each indices;
      sums: sum each 1+til each indices;
      ?[isEven; factorials; sums]
     }

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 08:01:38 ---
Error: assign
Trace:
  [3]  
  factorials: prd each 1+til each indices;
  sums: sum each 1+til each indices;
      ^
  ?[isEven; factorials; sums]


--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:01:40 ---
The issue is with multi-line function definitions in IPC mode. Let me write it as a single line:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:01:41 ---
  command:
    f: {[n] indices: 1+til n; isEven: 0=indices mod 2; factorials: prd each 1+til each indices; sums: sum each 1+til each indices; ?[isEven; factorials; sums] }

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 08:01:41 ---
Error: assign
Trace:
  [3]  f: {[n] indices: 1+til n; isEven: 0=indices mod 2; factorials: prd each 1+til each indices; sums: sum each 1+til each indices; ?[isEven; factorials; sums] }
                                                                                                       ^


--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:01:44 ---
Let me try a simpler approach using a more direct vectorized solution:

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:01:45 ---
  command:
    f: {[n] {$[0=x mod 2; prd 1+til x; sum 1+til x]} each 1+til n}

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 08:01:45 ---
None

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:01:48 ---
Great! Now let me test it with the example:

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:01:48 ---
  command:
    f[5]

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 08:01:48 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 6, 24, 15])

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:01:50 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more cases:

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:01:51 ---
  command:
    f[1]

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 08:01:51 ---
List_Int64([1])

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:01:55 ---
  command:
    f[3]

--- 30. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #29) at 08:01:55 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 6])

--- 31. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:01:57 ---
  command:
    f[7]

--- 32. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #31) at 08:01:58 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28])

--- 33. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:02:00 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 34. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:02:02 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_106_q_session_ed04b963/problem_solution_106.q
  content:
    f: {[n] {$[0=x mod 2; prd 1+til x; sum 1+til x]} each 1+til n};
    

--- 35. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:02:07 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_106.q`.

The implementation:
- Uses `1+til n` to generate indices from 1 to n
- For each index, checks if it's even with `0=x mod 2`
- If even: calculates factorial using `prd 1+til x` (product of 1 to x)
- If odd: calculates sum using `sum 1+til x` (sum of 1 to x)
- Leverages q's vectorized operations with `each` for clean, idiomatic code
