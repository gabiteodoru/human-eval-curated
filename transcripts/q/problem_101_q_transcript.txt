Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/101
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: words_string

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_101.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:55:37 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:55:40 ---
Now let me analyze the problem and develop a solution:

The task is to split a string by commas or spaces and return an array of words.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:55:41 ---
  command:
    / Test basic string splitting
    s: "Hi, my name is John";
    s

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:55:41 ---
String("Hi, my name is John")

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:55:44 ---
  command:
    / Replace commas with spaces, then split on spaces
    s: "Hi, my name is John";
    " " vs s

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 07:55:44 ---
List_Untyped([String("Hi,"), String("my"), String("name"), String("is"), String("John")])

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:55:46 ---
I need to handle commas. Let me replace commas with spaces first:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:55:47 ---
  command:
    / Replace commas with spaces
    s: "Hi, my name is John";
    s: ssr[s; ","; " "];
    s

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 07:55:47 ---
String("Hi  my name is John")

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:55:51 ---
  command:
    / Now split on spaces and filter out empty strings
    s: "Hi, my name is John";
    s: ssr[s; ","; " "];
    words: " " vs s;
    words

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 07:55:51 ---
List_Untyped([String("Hi"), String(""), String("my"), String("name"), String("is"), String("John")])

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:55:54 ---
  command:
    / Filter out empty strings
    s: "Hi, my name is John";
    s: ssr[s; ","; " "];
    words: " " vs s;
    words where count each words

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 07:55:54 ---
List_Untyped([String("Hi"), String("Hi"), String("my"), String("my"), String("name"), String("name"), String("name"), String("name"), String("is"), String("is"), String("John"), String("John"), String("John"), String("John")])

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:55:57 ---
That's not right. Let me use a different approach - filter where the length is greater than 0:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:55:58 ---
  command:
    / Filter out empty strings properly
    s: "Hi, my name is John";
    s: ssr[s; ","; " "];
    words: " " vs s;
    words where 0 < count each words

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 07:55:58 ---
List_Untyped([String("Hi"), String("my"), String("name"), String("is"), String("John")])

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:56:01 ---
Perfect! Now let me create the function and test it with both examples:

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:56:02 ---
  command:
    words_string: {[s] words: " " vs ssr[s; ","; " "]; words where 0 < count each words};

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 07:56:02 ---
None

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:56:05 ---
  command:
    words_string["Hi, my name is John"]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 07:56:05 ---
List_Untyped([String("Hi"), String("my"), String("name"), String("is"), String("John")])

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:56:08 ---
  command:
    words_string["One, two, three, four, five, six"]

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 07:56:08 ---
List_Untyped([String("One"), String("two"), String("three"), String("four"), String("five"), String("six")])

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:56:12 ---
Excellent! Both test cases pass. Let me test a few edge cases:

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:56:12 ---
  command:
    / Test with multiple spaces
    words_string["Hello    world"]

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 07:56:12 ---
List_Untyped([String("Hello"), String("world")])

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:56:17 ---
  command:
    / Test with multiple commas
    words_string["One,, two,  three"]

--- 30. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #29) at 07:56:17 ---
List_Untyped([String("One"), String("two"), String("three")])

--- 31. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:56:20 ---
Perfect! The solution handles all edge cases correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 32. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:56:22 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_101_q_session_8425b25e/problem_solution_101.q
  content:
    words_string: {[s] words: " " vs ssr[s; ","; " "]; words where 0 < count each words};
    

--- 33. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:56:26 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_101.q`.

The function works by:
1. Using `ssr[s; ","; " "]` to replace all commas with spaces
2. Using `" " vs` to split the string on spaces
3. Filtering out empty strings with `words where 0 < count each words`

This handles multiple commas, multiple spaces, and mixed separators correctly.
