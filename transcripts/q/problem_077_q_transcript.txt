Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/77
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def iscube(a):
    '''
    Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True 
    if this integer is a cube of some integer number.
    Note: you may assume the input is always valid.
    Examples:
    iscube(1) ==> True
    iscube(2) ==> False
    iscube(-1) ==> True
    iscube(64) ==> True
    iscube(0) ==> True
    iscube(180) ==> False
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: iscube

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_77.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:54:02 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:54:05 ---
Now let me develop and test the `iscube` function:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:54:07 ---
  command:
    iscube: {[a] cbrt: a xexp 1%3; rounded: floor 0.5 + cbrt; rounded = cbrt*cbrt*cbrt};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:54:07 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:54:13 ---
Wait, I need to reconsider this approach. For negative numbers and handling edge cases properly, let me think about the logic:

1. A number `a` is a cube if there exists an integer `n` such that `nÂ³ = a`
2. This works for positive, negative, and zero
3. For negative numbers, we need to handle the sign separately

Let me refine the solution:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:54:15 ---
  command:
    iscube: {[a] cbrt: a xexp 1%3; rounded: "j"$0.5 + abs cbrt; a = (signum[a] * rounded) xexp 3};

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:54:15 ---
None

--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:54:18 ---
Now let's test with the provided examples:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:54:18 ---
  command:
    iscube 1

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 23:54:18 ---
False

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:54:21 ---
The result is incorrect. Let me reconsider the approach. The issue is with how I'm handling the cube root calculation. Let me try a different strategy:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:54:23 ---
  command:
    iscube: {[a] $[a=0; 1b; cbrt: abs[a] xexp 1%3; rounded: "j"$0.5 + cbrt; a = (signum[a] * rounded) xexp 3]};

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:54:23 ---
None

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:54:25 ---
  command:
    iscube 1

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:54:25 ---

I have a syntax error in my conditional. Let me fix it:

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:54:25 ---
  command:
    iscube: {[a] cbrt: abs[a] xexp 1%3; rounded: "j"$0.5 + cbrt; a = (signum[a] * rounded) xexp 3};

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 23:54:25 ---
None

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:54:29 ---
  command:
    iscube 1

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 23:54:29 ---
False

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:54:32 ---
Still getting False for 1, which should be True. Let me debug this step by step:

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:54:33 ---
  command:
    a: 1; cbrt: abs[a] xexp 1%3; rounded: "j"$0.5 + cbrt; cube: (signum[a] * rounded) xexp 3; (cbrt; rounded; cube; a = cube)

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 23:54:33 ---
List_Untyped([1.0, 2, 8.0, False])

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:54:37 ---
I see the issue! When rounding, I'm getting 2 instead of 1. The problem is that `0.5 + cbrt` rounds up when cbrt is exactly 1. I should round to nearest integer properly:

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:54:38 ---
  command:
    a: 1; cbrt: abs[a] xexp 1%3; rounded: "j"$cbrt + 0.5; (cbrt; rounded)

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 23:54:38 ---
List_Untyped([1.0, 2])

--- 29. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:54:41 ---
The issue is that 0.5 + 1.0 = 1.5, which rounds to 2. I need to use proper rounding. Let me check both floor and ceiling:

--- 30. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:54:43 ---
  command:
    iscube: {[a] cbrt: abs[a] xexp 1%3; rounded: "j"$cbrt; candidate1: (signum[a] * rounded) xexp 3; candidate2: (signum[a] * rounded + 1) xexp 3; (a = candidate1) or a = candidate2};

--- 31. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #30) at 23:54:43 ---
None

--- 32. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:54:46 ---
  command:
    iscube each 1 2 -1 64 0 180

--- 33. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #32) at 23:54:46 ---
List_Bool([True, False, True, True, True, False])

--- 34. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:54:50 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to a file:

--- 35. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:54:52 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_77_q_session_c78ea59b/problem_solution_77.q
  content:
    iscube: {[a] cbrt: abs[a] xexp 1%3; rounded: "j"$cbrt; candidate1: (signum[a] * rounded) xexp 3; candidate2: (signum[a] * rounded + 1) xexp 3; (a = candidate1) or a = candidate2};
    

--- 36. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:54:54 ---
Solution complete! The `iscube` function:
1. Computes the cube root of the absolute value
2. Rounds down to get a candidate integer
3. Tests both the rounded value and rounded+1 (to handle floating point precision)
4. Checks if either candidate cubed equals the original number (preserving sign)
