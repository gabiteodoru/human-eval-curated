Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/9
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List, Tuple


def running_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of running maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    >>> running_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: running_max

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_9.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 22:47:47 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:47:51 ---
Now let me understand the problem: I need to generate a list of running maximum elements. This is a perfect use case for q's `scan` operator (`\`) combined with `max`.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:47:52 ---
  command:
    / Test the concept: max\ gives running maximum
    max\ 1 2 3 2 3 4 2

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:47:52 ---
Error:  
Trace:
  [3]  / Test the concept: max\ gives running maximum
max\ 1 2 3 2 3 4 2
    ^


--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:47:55 ---
Let me fix the syntax - I need to use semicolons:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:47:55 ---
  command:
    max\ 1 2 3 2 3 4 2

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 22:47:55 ---
Error:  
Trace:
  [3]  max\ 1 2 3 2 3 4 2
           ^


--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:47:58 ---
The issue is that `max\` needs a dyadic form. Let me use the proper scan syntax:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:47:59 ---
  command:
    (|)\[1 2 3 2 3 4 2]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 22:47:59 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4])

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:48:02 ---
Perfect! The `|` (max) operator with scan `\` gives us the running maximum. Let me create the function:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:48:03 ---
  command:
    running_max: {(|)\[x]}

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 22:48:03 ---
None

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:48:06 ---
Now let me test it with the example from the problem:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:48:06 ---
  command:
    running_max[1 2 3 2 3 4 2]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 22:48:06 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4])

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:48:09 ---
Excellent! Let me test a few more edge cases:

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:48:10 ---
  command:
    running_max[5 4 3 2 1]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 22:48:10 ---
List_Int64([5, 5, 5, 5, 5])

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:48:10 ---
  command:
    running_max[enlist 42]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 22:48:10 ---
List_Int64([42])

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:48:13 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 25. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:48:15 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_9_q_session_c3a2edb9/problem_solution_9.q
  content:
    running_max: {(|)\[x]}
    

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:48:20 ---
Done! The solution uses q's scan operator `\` with the max operator `|` to compute the running maximum in a single, idiomatic vectorized operation. This is equivalent to `maxs` in q, which is the built-in monadic form for maximum scan.
