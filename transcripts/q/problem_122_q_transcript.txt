Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/122
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def add_elements(arr, k):
    """
    Given a non-empty array of integers arr and an integer k, return
    the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.

    Example:

        Input: arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], k = 4
        Output: 24 # sum of 21 + 3

    Constraints:
        1. 1 <= len(arr) <= 100
        2. 1 <= k <= len(arr)
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: add_elements

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_122.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Now let me develop and test the solution. The problem asks to:
1. Take the first k elements of the array
2. Filter elements with at most two digits (i.e., -99 to 99)
3. Sum those elements

Let me start by exploring the logic:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:15:12 ---
  command:
    / Test data from the example
    arr: 111 21 3 4000 5 6 7 8 9;
    k: 4;
    arr

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 08:15:12 ---
List_Int64([111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:15:15 ---
  command:
    / Take first k elements
    k#arr

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 08:15:15 ---
List_Int64([111, 21, 3, 4000])

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:15:18 ---
  command:
    / Check which elements have at most 2 digits (abs value <= 99)
    abs each k#arr

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 08:15:18 ---
List_Int64([111, 21, 3, 4000])

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:15:20 ---
  command:
    / Filter elements where abs value <= 99
    (abs each k#arr) <= 99

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 08:15:20 ---
List_Bool([False, True, True, False])

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:15:24 ---
  command:
    / Get elements with at most 2 digits
    firstK: k#arr;
    hasAtMost2Digits: (abs firstK) <= 99;
    firstK where hasAtMost2Digits

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 08:15:24 ---
List_Int64([21, 3])

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:15:26 ---
  command:
    / Sum them
    sum firstK where hasAtMost2Digits

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 08:15:26 ---
24

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:15:30 ---
Perfect! Now let me create the function in a more vectorized, idiomatic q style:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:15:31 ---
  command:
    / Create the function
    add_elements: {[arr;k] sum (k#arr) where 99 >= abs k#arr};
    add_elements[arr;k]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 08:15:31 ---
24

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:15:33 ---
Excellent! Let me test with a few more cases to ensure correctness:

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:15:34 ---
  command:
    / Test with negative numbers
    add_elements[-50 100 -10 20; 3]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 08:15:34 ---
-60

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:15:36 ---
  command:
    / Test with all valid elements
    add_elements[1 2 3 4 5; 5]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 08:15:36 ---
15

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:15:39 ---
  command:
    / Test with no valid elements
    add_elements[1000 2000 3000; 2]

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 08:15:39 ---
0

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:15:43 ---
  command:
    / Test edge case with 99 and 100
    add_elements[99 100 -99 -100; 4]

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 08:15:43 ---
0

--- 29. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:15:46 ---
Perfect! All tests pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 30. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:15:48 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_122_q_session_8d8bdaff/problem_solution_122.q
  content:
    add_elements: {[arr;k] sum (k#arr) where 99 >= abs k#arr}
    

--- 31. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:15:53 ---
Solution complete! The function `add_elements` is written to `problem_solution_122.q`.

The implementation:
- Takes first `k` elements with `k#arr`
- Filters elements with at most 2 digits using `where 99 >= abs k#arr`
- Sums the filtered elements

This is idiomatic q: vectorized, concise, and leverages q's native operations.
