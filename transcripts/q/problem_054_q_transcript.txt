Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/54
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):
    """
    Check if two words have the same characters.
    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')
    True
    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')
    True
    >>> same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')
    True
    >>> same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')
    False
    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')
    False
    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')
    False
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: same_chars

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_54.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:31:46 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:31:49 ---
Now let me understand the problem and develop the solution. The function should check if two strings have the same set of unique characters (regardless of frequency).

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:31:50 ---
  command:
    / Test the logic: check if two strings have the same unique characters
    s0: "eabcdzzzz";
    s1: "dddzzzzzzzddeddabc";
    distinct s0

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:31:51 ---
String("eabcdz")

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:31:50 ---
  command:
    distinct s1

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:31:51 ---
String("dzeabc")

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:31:53 ---
  command:
    / Check if they have the same characters by comparing sorted distinct characters
    asc distinct s0

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 23:31:53 ---
String("abcdez")

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:31:56 ---
  command:
    asc distinct s1

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 23:31:56 ---
String("abcdez")

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:31:59 ---
Perfect! The approach is to compare the sorted distinct characters of both strings. Let me implement and test the solution:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:32:00 ---
  command:
    / Define the same_chars function
    same_chars: {[s0;s1] (asc distinct s0) ~ asc distinct s1}

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:32:00 ---
None

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:32:02 ---
Now let me test it with all the examples from the problem:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:32:03 ---
  command:
    / Test case 1: should return True (1b)
    same_chars["eabcdzzzz"; "dddzzzzzzzddeddabc"]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 23:32:03 ---
True

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:32:06 ---
  command:
    / Test case 2: should return True (1b)
    same_chars["abcd"; "dddddddabc"]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 23:32:06 ---
True

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:32:09 ---
  command:
    / Test case 3: should return True (1b)
    same_chars["dddddddabc"; "abcd"]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 23:32:09 ---
True

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:32:12 ---
  command:
    / Test case 4: should return False (0b)
    same_chars["eabcd"; "dddddddabc"]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 23:32:12 ---
False

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:32:16 ---
  command:
    / Test case 5: should return False (0b)
    same_chars["abcd"; "dddddddabce"]

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 23:32:16 ---
False

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:32:19 ---
  command:
    / Test case 6: should return False (0b)
    same_chars["eabcdzzzz"; "dddzzzzzzzddddabc"]

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 23:32:19 ---
False

--- 29. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:32:19 ---
Excellent! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 30. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:32:22 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_54_q_session_4937c6b8/problem_solution_54.q
  content:
    same_chars: {[s0;s1] (asc distinct s0) ~ asc distinct s1}
    

--- 31. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:32:26 ---
Solution complete! The `same_chars` function uses idiomatic q code:
- `distinct` extracts unique characters from each string
- `asc` sorts them alphabetically  
- `~` (match) checks if the sorted unique characters are identical

All test cases pass successfully.
