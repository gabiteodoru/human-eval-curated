Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/89
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def encrypt(s):
    """Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns an encrypted string using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 4 positions. Rules:
    Each letter is replaced by the letter 4 positions ahead in the alphabet
    The alphabet wraps around (e.g., 'w' → 'a', 'x' → 'b', 'y' → 'c', 'z' → 'd')
    Input will only contain lowercase letters
    
    For example:
    encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
    encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
    encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
    encrypt('et') returns 'ix'
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: encrypt

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_89.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

Let me check the calculation. I need to verify the logic:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:06:37 ---
  command:
    / Check: 'h' is 104, 'i' is 105

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:06:47 ---
Good! Now let me test the wrapping behavior for letters near the end of the alphabet:

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:06:48 ---
  command:
    / Test wrapping: 'w' -> 'a', 'x' -> 'b', 'y' -> 'c', 'z' -> 'd'
    encrypt["wxyz"]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 00:06:48 ---
String("{|}~")

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:06:51 ---
The simple shift doesn't handle wrapping. Let me fix this with the modulo approach:

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:06:53 ---
  command:
    / Correct implementation with wrapping
    encrypt: {[s]
      codes: `int$s;

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:06:59 ---
That's still not right. Let me check the calculation manually:

  command:
    / 'w' is 119, 'a' is 97

  command:
    / 18 + 97 = 115, which is 's', not 'a'
    / Wait, let me re-read the problem. 'w' + 4 should be...
    / w x y z a (counting 4 positions)
    / So 'w' is position 22 (0-indexed), +4 = 26, mod 26 = 0 ('a')
    / Let me check my math again
    22 + 4

I see the issue! Let me recalculate: w is at position 22 (w is the 23rd letter, 0-indexed). But wait, let me verify the expected output more carefully:

      shifted: 97 + ((codes - 97) + 4) mod 26;
      `char$shifted
     };
    

--- 79. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:08:27 ---
Done! The solution implements a Caesar cipher with a shift of 4 positions using vectorized q operations. The key insight was handling q's right-to-left evaluation order by using proper parentheses: `((codes - 97) + 4) mod 26`.
