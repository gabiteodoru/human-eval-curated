Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/142
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def sum_squares(lst):
    """"
    This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a 
    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not 
    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. 
    
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6
    For lst = []  the output should be 0
    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: sum_squares

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_142.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll help you solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+. Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:33:25 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:33:28 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
1. For indices that are multiples of 3: square the value
2. For indices that are multiples of 4 but NOT multiples of 3: cube the value
3. For other indices: keep the value unchanged
4. Return the sum of all transformed values

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:33:31 ---
  command:
    sum_squares: {[lst] $[0=count lst; 0; sum {$[0=x mod 3; y*y; 0=x mod 4; y*y*y; y]}[;lst] each til count lst]};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:33:31 ---

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:33:33 ---
Now let me test with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:33:34 ---

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:33:42 ---
I see there's an issue - it's returning the transformed list instead of the sum. Let me check my logic more carefully:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:33:43 ---
  command:
    lst: 1 2 3; indices: til count lst; indices

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 07:33:43 ---

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:33:47 ---
  command:
    / Index 0: multiple of 3, square: 1*1=1
    / Index 1: not multiple of 3 or 4, keep: 2
    / Index 2: not multiple of 3 or 4, keep: 3
    / Sum should be 1+2+3=6
    0 mod 3

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 07:33:47 ---
0

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:33:50 ---
  command:
    sum_squares: {[lst] sum {[idx;val] $[0=idx mod 3; val*val; 0=idx mod 4; val*val*val; val]}[;lst] each til count lst};

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 07:33:50 ---
None

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:33:52 ---
  command:
    sum_squares[1 2 3]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 07:33:52 ---
List_Int64([3, 8, 15])

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:33:55 ---
Let me debug this - it seems like the projection isn't working as expected:

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:33:56 ---
  command:
    lst: 1 2 3; {[idx;val] $[0=idx mod 3; val*val; 0=idx mod 4; val*val*val; val]}[0;lst[0]]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 07:33:56 ---
1

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:33:59 ---
  command:
    lst: 1 2 3; sum {[idx;val] $[0=idx mod 3; val*val; 0=idx mod 4; val*val*val; val]}[;lst] each til count lst

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 07:33:59 ---
List_Int64([3, 8, 15])

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:34:02 ---
I see the issue - the projection syntax is creating a list. Let me use a different approach:

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:34:02 ---
  command:
    lst: 1 2 3; sum {[idx;val] $[0=idx mod 3; val*val; 0=idx mod 4; val*val*val; val]}[til count lst; lst]

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 07:34:02 ---

--- 32. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:34:09 ---
Perfect! Now let me update the function and test all the examples:

--- 33. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:34:10 ---
  command:
    sum_squares: {[lst] sum {[idx;val] $[0=idx mod 3; val*val; 0=idx mod 4; val*val*val; val]}'[til count lst; lst]};

--- 34. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #33) at 07:34:10 ---

--- 35. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:34:13 ---

    sum_squares[-1 -5 2 -1 -5]

--- 40. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #39) at 07:34:19 ---
-126

--- 41. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:34:21 ---
Good! But I need to handle the empty list case. Let me check:

--- 42. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:34:21 ---
  command:
    sum ()

--- 43. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #42) at 07:34:21 ---
List_Untyped([])

--- 44. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:34:24 ---
I see - `sum` on an empty list returns an empty list. Let me fix this:

--- 45. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:34:25 ---
  command:
    sum_squares: {[lst] $[0=count lst; 0; sum {[idx;val] $[0=idx mod 3; val*val; 0=idx mod 4; val*val*val; val]}'[til count lst; lst]]};

--- 46. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #45) at 07:34:25 ---
None

--- 47. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:34:28 ---
  command:
    sum_squares[1 2 3]; sum_squares[()]; sum_squares[-1 -5 2 -1 -5]

--- 48. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #47) at 07:34:28 ---
-126

--- 49. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:34:30 ---
Let me test each case separately:

--- 50. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:34:30 ---
  command:
    sum_squares[1 2 3]

--- 51. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #50) at 07:34:30 ---
6

--- 52. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:34:33 ---
  command:
    sum_squares[()]

--- 53. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #52) at 07:34:33 ---
0

--- 54. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:34:36 ---
  command:
    sum_squares[-1 -5 2 -1 -5]

--- 55. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #54) at 07:34:36 ---
-126

--- 56. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:34:41 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me verify the logic once more with the third example to make sure it's correct:

--- 57. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:34:44 ---
  command:
    / Index 0 (multiple of 3): -1*-1 = 1
    / Index 1 (not 3 or 4): -5 stays -5  
    / Index 2 (not 3 or 4): 2 stays 2
    / Index 3 (multiple of 3): -1*-1 = 1
    / Index 4 (multiple of 4, not 3): -5*-5*-5 = -125
    / Sum: 1 + (-5) + 2 + 1 + (-125) = -126
    {[idx;val] $[0=idx mod 3; val*val; 0=idx mod 4; val*val*val; val]}'[til 5; -1 -5 2 -1 -5]

--- 58. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #57) at 07:34:44 ---
List_Int64([1, -5, 2, 1, -125])

--- 59. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:34:47 ---
Excellent! The logic is correct. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 60. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:34:50 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_142_q_session_a17005ec/problem_solution_142.q
  content:
    sum_squares: {[lst] $[0=count lst; 0; sum {[idx;val] $[0=idx mod 3; val*val; 0=idx mod 4; val*val*val; val]}'[til count lst; lst]]}
    

--- 61. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:34:54 ---
Solution completed! The `sum_squares` function:
- Returns 0 for empty lists
- Squares values at indices that are multiples of 3
- Cubes values at indices that are multiples of 4 (but not 3)
- Keeps other values unchanged
- Returns the sum of all transformed values
