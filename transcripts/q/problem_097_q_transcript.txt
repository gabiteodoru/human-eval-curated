Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/97
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def multiply(a, b):
    """Complete the function that takes two integers and returns 
    the product of their unit digits.
    Assume the input is always valid.
    Examples:
    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.
    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.
    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.
    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: multiply

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_97.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEal problem step by step.

First, let me connect to the q server and then develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:51:55 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:51:58 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- Take two integers a and b
- Return the product of their unit digits (last digits)
- Handle negative numbers (unit digit is the absolute value of the last digit)

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:51:59 ---
  command:
    multiply: {[a;b] (abs[a] mod 10) * abs[b] mod 10};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:51:59 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:52:02 ---
  command:
    multiply[148; 412]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 07:52:02 ---
16

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:52:04 ---
  command:
    multiply[19; 28]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 07:52:04 ---
72

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:52:06 ---
  command:
    multiply[2020; 1851]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 07:52:06 ---
0

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:52:09 ---
  command:
    multiply[14; -15]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 07:52:09 ---
20

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:52:13 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 16. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:52:16 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_97_q_session_537830d7/problem_solution_97.q
  content:
    multiply: {[a;b] (abs[a] mod 10) * abs[b] mod 10}
    

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:52:20 ---
Done! The solution extracts the unit digit from each number using `abs[x] mod 10` (to handle negative numbers) and multiplies them together. All test cases pass:
- `multiply[148; 412]` = 16 (8 × 2)
- `multiply[19; 28]` = 72 (9 × 8)
- `multiply[2020; 1851]` = 0 (0 × 1)
- `multiply[14; -15]` = 20 (4 × 5)
