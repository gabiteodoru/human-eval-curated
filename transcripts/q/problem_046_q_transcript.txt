Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

Problem HumanEval/46

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:

    fib4(3) -> 0

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: fib4

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_46.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:24:30 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:24:31 ---
Now let me understand the Fib4 sequence:
- fib4(0) = 0
- fib4(1) = 0
- fib4(2) = 2
- fib4(3) = 0
- fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

The key is to implement this efficiently without recursion. I'll use an iterative approach with q's scan operator:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:24:33 ---
  command:
    fib4: {[n] if[n<4; :0 0 2 0 n]; result: {x[1],x[2],x[3],sum x}\ [0 0 2 0; til n-3]; last result};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:24:33 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:24:36 ---
Let me test the examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:24:36 ---
  command:
    fib4[5]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:24:36 ---

I need to fix the scan syntax. Let me rewrite:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:24:41 ---
  command:
    fib4: {[n] if[n<4; :(0 0 2 0)[n]]; state: 0 0 2 0; i:0; while[i<n-3; state: state[1],state[2],state[3],sum state; i+:1]; last state};

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:24:52 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly. Let me test the base cases as well:

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:24:53 ---
  command:
    fib4 each 0 1 2 3

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 23:24:53 ---
List_Int64([0, 0, 2, 0])

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:24:56 ---
Excellent! However, let me improve this to use a more idiomatic q approach with scan instead of while loop:

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:24:57 ---
  command:
    fib4: {[n] if[n<4; :(0 0 2 0)[n]]; last (n-3) {y[1],y[2],y[3],sum y}/ 0 0 2 0};

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:25:00 ---

I see the issue - the over (/) operator syntax needs adjustment. Let me fix this:

The bracket syntax for over is causing issues. Let me use the do form which is cleaner:

--- 33. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:25:09 ---
  command:
    fib4: {[n] if[n<4; :(0 0 2 0)[n]]; last (n-3) {x[1],x[2],x[3],sum x}\0 0 2 0};

The scan operator is returning all intermediate states. I need the final value, so let me use the last of the scan or revert to my working while loop solution:

--- 38. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:25:17 ---
  command:
    fib4: {[n] if[n<4; :(0 0 2 0)[n]]; state: 0 0 2 0; i:0; while[i<n-3; state: state[1],state[2],state[3],sum state; i+:1]; last state};

--- 40. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:25:21 ---
  command:
    fib4 each 0 1 2 3 5 6 7

--- 41. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #40) at 23:25:21 ---
List_Int64([0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 8, 14])

--- 42. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:25:24 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more cases to ensure correctness:

--- 43. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:25:24 ---
  command:
    fib4 each 4 8 10

--- 44. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #43) at 23:25:24 ---
List_Int64([2, 28, 104])

--- 45. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:25:27 ---
Great! Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 46. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:25:30 ---

--- 47. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:25:32 ---
Solution complete! The `fib4` function efficiently computes the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence using an iterative approach:

- For n < 4: returns the base case values (0, 0, 2, 0)
- For n â‰¥ 4: uses a while loop to maintain a sliding window of the last 4 values, computing each new value as the sum of the previous 4, until reaching the n-th element

The solution avoids recursion and runs in O(n) time with O(1) space.
