Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/56
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: correct_bracketing

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_56.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:33:49 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:33:52 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- We need to check if brackets are properly balanced
- "<" is an opening bracket, ">" is a closing bracket
- Every opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket
- The brackets must be in the correct order (no closing before opening)

The key insight is to track the balance: increment for "<", decrement for ">". The string is valid if:
1. The balance never goes negative (no closing bracket without a preceding opening)
2. The final balance is 0 (all brackets are matched)

Let me develop this solution:

  command:
    / Convert bracket to +1 or -1
    brackets: "<>";

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:34:06 ---
Good! Now let me create the complete function and test it with all the examples:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:34:07 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing: {[brackets] running: sums ?[brackets="<";1;-1]; (0<=min running) and 0=last running};

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:34:07 ---
None

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:34:11 ---
  command:
    / Test case 1: "<" should return False
    correct_bracketing["<"]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:34:11 ---
False

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:34:14 ---
  command:
    / Test case 2: "<>" should return True
    correct_bracketing["<>"]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 23:34:14 ---
True

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:34:16 ---

    correct_bracketing["<<><>>"]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 23:34:16 ---

    correct_bracketing["><<>"]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 23:34:19 ---
False

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:34:22 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me also test an edge case:

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:34:22 ---
  command:
    / Test edge case: empty string should return True
    correct_bracketing[""]

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 23:34:22 ---
False

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:34:25 ---
Hmm, let me check why empty string returns False:

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:34:26 ---
  command:
    / Debug empty string
    s: "";
    values: ?[s="<";1;-1];
    running: sums values;
    running

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 23:34:26 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 30. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:34:29 ---
  command:
    / Check what last returns on empty list
    last ()`int

--- 31. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #30) at 23:34:29 ---

MAXVAL_int64

--- 34. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:34:36 ---
I see - for empty list, `min` returns max int (0W) and `last` returns 0. Let me fix this to handle empty strings properly:

--- 35. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:34:38 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing: {[brackets] running: sums ?[brackets="<";1;-1]; (0=count running) or (0<=min running) and 0=last running};

--- 36. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #35) at 23:34:38 ---
None

--- 37. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:34:41 ---
  command:
    / Re-test all cases
    correct_bracketing["<"]

--- 38. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #37) at 23:34:41 ---
False

--- 39. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:34:44 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing["<>"]

--- 40. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #39) at 23:34:44 ---
True

--- 41. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:34:46 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing["<<><>>"]

--- 42. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #41) at 23:34:46 ---
True

--- 43. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:34:47 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing["><<>"]

--- 44. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #43) at 23:34:47 ---
False

--- 45. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:34:49 ---
  command:
    correct_bracketing[""]

--- 46. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #45) at 23:34:49 ---
True

--- 47. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:34:52 ---
Excellent! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to a file:

--- 48. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:34:55 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_56_q_session_d3a6d8db/problem_solution_56.q
  content:
    correct_bracketing: {[brackets] running: sums ?[brackets="<";1;-1]; (0=count running) or (0<=min running) and 0=last running};
    

--- 49. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:35:01 ---
Perfect! I've successfully solved HumanEval/56 using native q/kdb+.

**Solution summary:**
- Maps each `<` to `1` and each `>` to `-1`
- Uses `sums` to compute the running balance
- Validates that the balance never goes negative (using `min`) and ends at 0 (using `last`)
- Handles empty strings correctly

The solution is vectorized, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths with functional operations rather than loops.
