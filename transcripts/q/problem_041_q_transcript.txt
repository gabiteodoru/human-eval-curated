Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/41
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: car_race_collision

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_41.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using q/kdb+.

First, let me understand the problem:
- n cars moving left to right
- n cars moving right to left
- They all move at the same speed
- Each left-to-right car will collide with each right-to-left car
- We need to count total collisions

This is actually a simple combinatorics problem: each of the n cars going left-to-right will collide with each of the n cars going right-to-left, so the answer is n * n.

Let me connect to the q server and develop the solution:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:19:38 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:19:42 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:19:43 ---
  command:
    car_race_collision: {[n] n*n};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:19:43 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:19:46 ---
Let me test this with some examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:19:46 ---
  command:
    car_race_collision[1]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:19:46 ---
1

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:19:49 ---
  command:
    car_race_collision[2]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:19:49 ---
4

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:19:52 ---
  command:
    car_race_collision[5]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 23:19:52 ---
25

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:19:55 ---
  command:
    car_race_collision[10]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:19:55 ---
100

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:19:58 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 17. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:20:00 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_41_q_session_03654e2b/problem_solution_41.q
  content:
    car_race_collision: {[n] n*n}
    

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:20:04 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_41.q`.

The logic is straightforward: since all n cars moving left-to-right will eventually collide with all n cars moving right-to-left, the total number of collisions is n Ã— n.
