Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/118
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def get_closest_vowel(word):
    """You are given a word. Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between 
    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).
    
    Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count. Return empty string if you didn't
    find any vowel met the above condition. 

    You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.

    Example:
    get_closest_vowel("yogurt") ==> "u"
    get_closest_vowel("FULL") ==> "U"
    get_closest_vowel("quick") ==> ""
    get_closest_vowel("ab") ==> ""
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: get_closest_vowel

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_118.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEal problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

Now let me analyze the problem:
1. Find a vowel that stands between two consonants
2. Search from the right side of the word
3. Vowels at beginning and ending don't count
4. Return empty string if no such vowel exists

Let me develop and test the solution:

Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_118_q_session_06975232/problem_solution_118.q

    get_closest_vowel:{[word]
      if[3>count word; :""];
      vowel_mask:word in "aeiouAEIOU";
      / Check positions 1 to n-2, search from right
      indices:reverse 1_-1_til count word;
      / Find first index where: vowel at i, consonants at i-1 and i+1
      idx:first indices where {[vm;i] vm[i] and (not vm[i-1]) and not vm[i+1]}[vowel_mask;] each indices;
      $[null idx; ""; string word[idx]]
     };
    

--- 46. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:11:48 ---
Solution complete! The function `get_closest_vowel` has been written to `problem_solution_118.q`.

The implementation:
- Returns empty string for words with fewer than 3 characters
- Creates a boolean mask to identify vowels using vectorized `in` operator
- Searches from right to left through valid positions (excluding first and last characters)
- Finds the first vowel that has consonants on both sides
- Returns the vowel character as a string, or empty string if none found
