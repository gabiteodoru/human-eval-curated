Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/80
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def is_happy(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.
    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct
    For example:
    is_happy('a') => False
    is_happy('aa') => False
    is_happy('abcd') => True
    is_happy('aabb') => False
    is_happy('adb') => True
    is_happy('xyy') => False
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: is_happy

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_80.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEal problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:57:09 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:57:13 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- Check if string length is at least 3
- Check if every 3 consecutive letters are distinct
- Return boolean (1b for happy, 0b for not happy)

Let me develop the solution using q:

--- 29. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:57:49 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to a file:

--- 30. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:57:51 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_80_q_session_2ef3495f/problem_solution_80.q
  content:
    is_happy: {[s]
      if[3>count s; :0b];
      windows: {3 sublist x _ y}[;s] each til 1+count[s]-3;
      all 3=count each distinct each windows
      }
    

--- 31. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:57:57 ---
Solution complete! The `is_happy` function:

1. **Checks length**: Returns `0b` (false) if the string has fewer than 3 characters
2. **Creates 3-character windows**: Uses `{3 sublist x _ y}[;s] each til 1+count[s]-3` to generate all consecutive 3-character substrings
3. **Validates distinctness**: Checks that each window has exactly 3 distinct characters (`3=count each distinct each windows`)
4. **Returns result**: Uses `all` to ensure every window satisfies the condition

All test cases pass successfully.
