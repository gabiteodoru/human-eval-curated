Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/66
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def digitSum(s):
    """Task
    Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the upper characters only'
    ASCII codes.

    Examples:
        digitSum("") => 0
        digitSum("abAB") => 131
        digitSum("abcCd") => 67
        digitSum("helloE") => 69
        digitSum("woArBld") => 131
        digitSum("aAaaaXa") => 153
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: digitSum

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_66.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:43:26 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:43:30 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- Take a string as input
- Return the sum of ASCII codes of ONLY uppercase characters
- Ignore lowercase and other characters

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:43:31 ---
  command:
    digitSum: {sum "i"$x where x within "AZ"};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:43:31 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:43:33 ---
Now let me test with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:43:34 ---
  command:
    digitSum[""]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:43:34 ---
Int32(0)

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:43:36 ---
  command:
    digitSum["abAB"]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:43:36 ---
Int32(131)

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:43:36 ---
  command:
    digitSum["abcCd"]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 23:43:36 ---
Int32(67)

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:43:39 ---
  command:
    digitSum["helloE"]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:43:39 ---
Int32(69)

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:43:42 ---
  command:
    digitSum["woArBld"]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:43:42 ---
Int32(131)

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:43:45 ---
  command:
    digitSum["aAaaaXa"]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 23:43:45 ---
Int32(153)

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:43:48 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 21. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:43:50 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_66_q_session_b1663cd1/problem_solution_66.q
  content:
    digitSum: {sum "i"$x where x within "AZ"}
    

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:43:55 ---
Solution complete! The function uses idiomatic q/kdb+:

- `x within "AZ"` - vectorized operation to check which characters are uppercase (A-Z)
- `where` - filters to only uppercase characters
- `"i"$` - converts characters to ASCII integer codes
- `sum` - sums the ASCII values

All test cases pass successfully.
