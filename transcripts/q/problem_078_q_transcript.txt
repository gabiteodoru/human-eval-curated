Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/78
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def hex_key(num):
    """You have been tasked to write a function that receives 
    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal 
    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number 
    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).
    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, 
    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
    Examples:
    For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
    For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
    For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.
    For num = "123456789ABCDEF0" the output should be 6.
    For num = "2020" the output should be 2.

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: hex_key

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_78.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:55:07 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:55:12 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- We need to count hexadecimal digits that are prime numbers
- Hex digits: 0-9, A-F
- Prime hex digits are: 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11), D (13)

Let me develop the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:55:13 ---
  command:
    / Define the prime hex digits
    primeHexDigits: "2357BD"

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:55:13 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:55:16 ---
  command:
    / Test the prime hex digits definition
    primeHexDigits

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:55:16 ---
String("2357BD")

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:55:20 ---
  command:
    / Define hex_key function using vectorized operations
    hex_key: {[num] sum num in "2357BD"}

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 23:55:20 ---

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:55:22 ---
Now let me test it with the provided examples:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:55:23 ---
  command:
    / Test case 1: "AB" should return 1
    hex_key["AB"]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 23:55:23 ---
Int32(1)

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:55:24 ---
  command:
    / Test case 2: "1077E" should return 2
    hex_key["1077E"]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:55:24 ---
Int32(2)

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:55:27 ---
  command:
    / Test case 3: "ABED1A33" should return 4
    hex_key["ABED1A33"]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:55:27 ---
Int32(4)

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:55:29 ---
  command:
    / Test case 4: "123456789ABCDEF0" should return 6
    hex_key["123456789ABCDEF0"]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 23:55:30 ---
Int32(6)

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:55:32 ---
  command:
    / Test case 5: "2020" should return 2
    hex_key["2020"]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 23:55:32 ---
Int32(2)

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:55:37 ---
  command:
    / Test case 6: Empty string should return 0
    hex_key[""]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 23:55:37 ---
Int32(0)

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:55:43 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. The solution is very simple and idiomatic q:
- `num in "2357BD"` creates a boolean vector where each element is 1b if the character is a prime hex digit, 0b otherwise
- `sum` adds up the boolean values (treating 1b as 1 and 0b as 0)

Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 25. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:55:46 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_78_q_session_95d2d3cc/problem_solution_78.q
  content:
    hex_key: {[num] sum num in "2357BD"}
    

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:55:49 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_78.q`. 

The function `hex_key` uses a vectorized approach:
- `num in "2357BD"` checks each character against the prime hex digits (2, 3, 5, 7, B, D)
- `sum` counts the matches

This is idiomatic q that leverages vectorization instead of loops.
