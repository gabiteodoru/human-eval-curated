Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/95
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def check_dict_case(dict):
    """
    Given a dictionary, return True if all keys are strings in lower 
    case or all keys are strings in upper case, else return False.
    The function should return False is the given dictionary is empty.
    Examples:
    check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "b":"banana"}) should return True.
    check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "A":"banana", "B":"banana"}) should return False.
    check_dict_case({"a":"apple", 8:"banana", "a":"apple"}) should return False.
    check_dict_case({"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"}) should return False.
    check_dict_case({"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" }) should return True.
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: check_dict_case

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_95.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:49:35 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:49:39 ---
Now let me understand the requirements and develop the solution:

1. Check if all keys are strings (symbols in q)
2. Return False if dictionary is empty
3. Return True if all keys are lowercase OR all keys are uppercase
4. Return False otherwise (mixed case, non-string keys, etc.)

Let me start by exploring how to work with dictionaries in q:

  command:
    / Test dictionary
    d1:`a`b!("apple";"banana");
    d1

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:49:40 ---
{[Symbol->String] "a": "String("apple")", "b": "String("banana")"}

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:49:43 ---

    ks

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:49:56 ---

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:49:59 ---
  command:
    check_dict_case:{[dict]
      / Return False if empty
      if[0=count dict; :0b];
      / Get keys
      k:key dict;
      / Check if all keys are symbols
      if[not all -11h=type each k; :0b];
      / Convert to strings
      ks:string k;
      / Check if all lowercase or all uppercase
      all_lower:all ks~'lower ks;
      all_upper:all ks~'upper ks;
      all_lower or all_upper
      };

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 07:49:59 ---
None

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:50:02 ---
Now let me test the function with the provided examples:

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:50:03 ---
  command:
    / Test case 1: all lowercase - should return True
    check_dict_case[`a`b!("apple";"banana")]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 07:50:03 ---
True

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:50:06 ---
  command:
    / Test case 2: mixed case - should return False
    check_dict_case[`a`A`B!("apple";"banana";"banana")]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 07:50:06 ---
False

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:50:09 ---
  command:
    / Test case 3: non-symbol key - should return False
    check_dict_case[(`a,8,`a)!("apple";"banana";"apple")]

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 07:50:09 ---
False

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:50:12 ---
  command:

    check_dict_case[`Name`Age`City!("John";"36";"Houston")]

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 07:50:12 ---
False

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:50:15 ---
  command:
    / Test case 5: all uppercase - should return True
    check_dict_case[`STATE`ZIP!("NC";"12345")]

--- 30. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #29) at 07:50:15 ---
True

--- 31. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:50:17 ---
  command:
    / Test case 6: empty dictionary - should return False
    check_dict_case[(()!())]

--- 32. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #31) at 07:50:17 ---
False

--- 33. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:50:20 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 34. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:50:25 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_95_q_session_e057fd9a/problem_solution_95.q
  content:
    check_dict_case:{[dict]
      / Return False if empty
      if[0=count dict; :0b];
      / Get keys
      k:key dict;
      / Check if all keys are symbols
      if[not all -11h=type each k; :0b];
      / Convert to strings
      ks:string k;
      / Check if all lowercase or all uppercase
      all_lower:all ks~'lower ks;
      all_upper:all ks~'upper ks;
      all_lower or all_upper
      };
    

--- 35. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:50:30 ---
Solution complete! The `check_dict_case` function:

1. Returns `0b` (False) if the dictionary is empty
2. Extracts all keys and verifies they are all symbols (type `-11h`)
3. Converts symbols to strings and checks if all are lowercase OR all are uppercase
4. Returns True only if all keys are consistently cased (all lower or all upper)

The solution uses idiomatic q with vectorized operations (`~'` for each-both comparison) and leverages q's built-in `lower` and `upper` functions.
