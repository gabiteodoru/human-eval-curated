Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/36
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: fizz_buzz

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_36.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution:

  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:12:39 ---
Now let me understand the problem and develop the solution:

1. Find integers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13
2. Count how many times the digit 7 appears in those integers

Let me start by developing the solution step by step:

    / Find numbers < 50 divisible by 11 or 13
    nums: til 50;
    divisible: nums where (0 = nums mod 11) or 0 = nums mod 13;
    divisible

  command:
    / Test with n=78, expected result is 2
    nums: til 78;

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:13:00 ---
  command:
    / Test with n=79, expected result is 3
    nums: til 79;
    divisible: nums where (0 = nums mod 11) or 0 = nums mod 13;
    divisible

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 23:13:00 ---
List_Int64([0, 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44, 52, 55, 65, 66, 77, 78])

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:13:04 ---
  command:
    / Count 7s - 77 has two 7s, 78 has one 7
    nums: 0 11 13 22 26 33 39 44 52 55 65 66 77 78;

    sum {sum "7" = x} each strings

Int32(3)

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:13:08 ---
Excellent! All test cases pass. Now let me create the complete function:

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:13:09 ---
  command:
    fizz_buzz: {[n] sum {sum "7" = x} each string each (til n) where (0 = (til n) mod 11) or 0 = (til n) mod 13};
    fizz_buzz[50]

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 23:13:09 ---
Int32(0)

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:13:13 ---
  command:
    fizz_buzz[78]

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 23:13:13 ---
Int32(2)

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:13:13 ---
  command:
    fizz_buzz[79]

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 23:13:13 ---
Int32(3)

--- 30. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:13:16 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to a file:

--- 31. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:13:18 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_36_q_session_84d8ceb5/problem_solution_36.q
  content:
    fizz_buzz: {[n] sum {sum "7" = x} each string each (til n) where (0 = (til n) mod 11) or 0 = (til n) mod 13}
    

--- 32. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:13:23 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_36.q`. 

The function works by:
1. Using `til n` to generate integers from 0 to n-1
2. Filtering with `where` to find numbers divisible by 11 or 13
3. Converting each number to a string with `string each`
4. Counting "7" characters in each string with `{sum "7" = x} each`
5. Summing the total count

All three test cases pass: fizz_buzz(50)=0, fizz_buzz(78)=2, fizz_buzz(79)=3.
