Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/107
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd
    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.

    Example 1:

        Input: 3
        Output: (1, 2)
        Explanation:
        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.

    Example 2:

        Input: 12
        Output: (4, 6)
        Explanation:
        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.

    Note:
        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3
        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: even_odd_palindrome

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_107.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 08:02:18 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:02:21 ---
Now let me develop the solution. First, I need to understand what makes a number a palindrome and then count even vs odd palindromes.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:02:23 ---
  command:
    / Helper function to check if a number is a palindrome
    isPalindrome: {s:string x; s~reverse s};
    isPalindrome each 1 2 3 11 12 121

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 08:02:23 ---
List_Bool([True, True, True, True, False, True])

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:02:26 ---
  command:
    / Test the logic - get all numbers from 1 to n
    n:3;
    nums: 1 + til n;
    nums

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 08:02:26 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 3])

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:02:29 ---
  command:
    / Filter to palindromes
    palindromes: nums where isPalindrome each nums;
    palindromes

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 08:02:29 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 3])

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:02:32 ---
  command:
    / Count even and odd palindromes
    evenCount: sum 0 = palindromes mod 2;
    oddCount: sum 1 = palindromes mod 2;
    (evenCount; oddCount)

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 08:02:32 ---
List_Int32([1, 2])

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:02:35 ---
Great! Now let me test with the second example (n=12):

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:02:35 ---
  command:
    / Test with n=12
    n:12;
    nums: 1 + til n;
    palindromes: nums where isPalindrome each nums;
    palindromes

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 08:02:35 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11])

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:02:38 ---
  command:
    evenCount: sum 0 = palindromes mod 2;
    oddCount: sum 1 = palindromes mod 2;
    (evenCount; oddCount)

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 08:02:38 ---
List_Int32([4, 6])

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:02:41 ---
Perfect! Both test cases pass. Now let me create the complete function:

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:02:43 ---
  command:
    even_odd_palindrome: {[n]
      isPalin: {s:string x; s~reverse s};
      nums: 1 + til n;
      palindromes: nums where isPalin each nums;
      evenCount: sum 0 = palindromes mod 2;
      oddCount: sum 1 = palindromes mod 2;
      (evenCount; oddCount)
     };
    even_odd_palindrome[3]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 08:02:43 ---
List_Int32([1, 2])

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:02:46 ---
  command:
    even_odd_palindrome[12]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 08:02:46 ---
List_Int32([4, 6])

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:02:49 ---
Excellent! Let me test a few more edge cases to ensure robustness:

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:02:50 ---
  command:
    even_odd_palindrome[1]

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 08:02:50 ---
List_Int32([0, 1])

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:02:52 ---
  command:
    even_odd_palindrome[100]

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 08:02:52 ---
List_Int32([8, 10])

--- 28. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:02:55 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 29. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:02:57 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_107_q_session_5be0cb26/problem_solution_107.q
  content:
    even_odd_palindrome: {[n]
      isPalin: {s:string x; s~reverse s};
      nums: 1 + til n;
      palindromes: nums where isPalin each nums;
      evenCount: sum 0 = palindromes mod 2;
      oddCount: sum 1 = palindromes mod 2;
      (evenCount; oddCount)
     };
    

--- 30. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:03:03 ---
Solution complete! The function:

1. Defines a helper function `isPalin` to check if a number is a palindrome by converting to string and comparing with its reverse
2. Generates all numbers from 1 to n using `1 + til n`
3. Filters to keep only palindromes
4. Counts even palindromes (where `palindromes mod 2` equals 0)
5. Counts odd palindromes (where `palindromes mod 2` equals 1)
6. Returns the counts as a tuple `(evenCount; oddCount)`

Tested with examples: `even_odd_palindrome[3]` returns `(1; 2)` and `even_odd_palindrome[12]` returns `(4; 6)`.
