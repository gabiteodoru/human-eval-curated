Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/117
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: select_words

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_117.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

Good! Now let me develop the solution. I need to:
1. Split the string into words
2. For each word, count consonants (letters that are not vowels)
3. Filter words that have exactly n consonants

Let me start by testing my approach:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:09:15 ---
  command:
    / Test splitting words
    s:"Mary had a little lamb";
    words:" " vs s;
    words

    / Check which characters are letters (all are in this case since input only has letters and spaces)
    / Check which are NOT vowels
    consonants:word where not word in vowels;
    consonants

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:09:28 ---
Perfect! Now let me create a function to count consonants and test the full solution:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:09:29 ---
  command:
    / Helper function to count consonants in a word
    countConsonants:{[word]

      count word where not word in vowels
     };
    countConsonants["Mary"]

      / Split into words
      words:" " vs s;
      / Count consonants for each word
      consonantCounts:count each words where\:/: not words in\:\: vowels;
      / Select words with exactly n consonants
      words where consonantCounts = n
     };
    select_words["Mary had a little lamb";4]

--- 39. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:10:15 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_117_q_session_62e9c943/problem_solution_117.q
  content:
    select_words:{[s;n]
      / Handle empty string case
      if[0=count s; :()];
      / Split into words
      words:" " vs s;
      / Count consonants for each word
      consonantCounts:{count x where not x in "aeiouAEIOU"} each words;
      / Select words with exactly n consonants
      words where consonantCounts = n
     };
    

--- 40. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:10:19 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_117.q`.

The function works by:
1. Handling the empty string case by returning an empty list
2. Splitting the input string by spaces to get individual words
3. Counting consonants in each word by filtering out vowels (both uppercase and lowercase)
4. Returning only the words where the consonant count equals n

All test cases pass successfully.
