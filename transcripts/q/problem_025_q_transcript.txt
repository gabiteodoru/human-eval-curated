Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/25
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List


def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: factorize

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_25.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

Now let me develop the factorize function. The algorithm should find all prime factors of a number by repeatedly dividing by the smallest factor until we're left with 1.

      factors: ();
      i: 2;
      while[n > 1;
        while[0 = n mod i;
          factors,: i;
          n: n div i
        ];
        i+: 1

      factors
    };

    factorize[17]

      ];
      factors
    }

Solution complete! The `factorize` function:

- Takes an integer `n` and returns a list of prime factors in ascending order
- Uses trial division starting from 2
- Each factor appears as many times as it divides the number
- All test cases pass: `factorize[8]` → `2 2 2`, `factorize[25]` → `5 5`, `factorize[70]` → `2 5 7`
