Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/111
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def histogram(test):
    """Given a string representing a space separated lowercase letters, return a dictionary
    of the letter with the most repetition and containing the corresponding count.
    If several letters have the same occurrence, return all of them.
    
    Example:
    histogram('a b c') == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
    histogram('a b b a') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
    histogram('a b c a b') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
    histogram('b b b b a') == {'b': 4}
    histogram('') == {}

    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: histogram

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_111.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEal problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 10:04:13 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:04:17 ---
Now let me develop the solution. The problem requires:
1. Parse a space-separated string of lowercase letters
2. Count occurrences of each letter
3. Return a dictionary of letters with the maximum count
4. If multiple letters have the same max count, return all of them

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:04:20 ---
  command:
    histogram: {[test]
      if[0=count test; :()!()];
      letters: `$" " vs test;
      if[0=count letters where not null letters; :()!()];
      counts: count each group letters;
      maxCount: max counts;
      result: counts where counts = maxCount;
      result
      };

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 10:04:20 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:04:22 ---
Now let me test with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:04:22 ---
  command:
    histogram["a b c"];

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 10:04:23 ---

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__get_last_query_result_q_view (Message #1) at 10:04:26 ---
  (no parameters)

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:04:29 ---
Let me check the result more carefully:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:04:29 ---
  command:
    show histogram["a b c"];

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 10:04:29 ---

  (no parameters)

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:04:34 ---
Let me debug this step by step:

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:04:34 ---
  command:
    test: "a b c";

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 10:04:34 ---

  (no parameters)

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:04:44 ---
Let me try a different approach to see the output:

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:04:45 ---
  command:
    " " vs "a b c";

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 10:04:45 ---

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:04:47 ---
Let me try with console output:

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:04:48 ---
  command:
    .Q.s " " vs "a b c";
  console_output_only: True

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 10:04:48 ---

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__get_last_query_result_q_view (Message #1) at 10:04:51 ---
  (no parameters)

--- 30. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:04:53 ---
Let me try a simple test to verify the connection is working:

--- 31. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:04:54 ---
  command:
    1+1

--- 32. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #31) at 10:04:54 ---

--- 33. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:04:56 ---
Good! Now let me work on the solution step by step:

--- 34. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:04:57 ---
  command:
    " " vs "a b c"

--- 35. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #34) at 10:04:57 ---
List_Untyped([String("a"), String("b"), String("c")])

--- 36. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:04:59 ---

--- 37. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:05:00 ---
  command:
    letters: `$" " vs "a b c"; letters

--- 38. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #37) at 10:05:00 ---

  command:
    counts where counts = max counts

--- 49. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #48) at 10:05:14 ---

--- 52. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:05:20 ---
Let me use a better approach with dictionary indexing:

--- 53. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:05:20 ---
  command:
    mask: counts = max counts; mask

--- 54. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #53) at 10:05:20 ---

--- 62. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:05:32 ---
Good! Now let me build the result dictionary:

--- 63. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:05:33 ---
  command:
    k: key[counts] where value[counts] = max value counts; v: value[counts] where value[counts] = max value counts; k!v

--- 64. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #63) at 10:05:33 ---

      counts: count each group letters;
      k: key[counts] where value[counts] = max value counts;
      v: value[counts] where value[counts] = max value counts;
      k!v
      };

--- 68. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:05:41 ---
Now let me test all the examples:

--- 70. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #69) at 10:05:41 ---

--- 81. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:06:04 ---
Solution complete! The `histogram` function:
1. Returns empty dict for empty input
2. Splits the input string by spaces and converts to symbols
3. Groups letters and counts occurrences
4. Filters to only letters with the maximum count
5. Returns a dictionary of those letters with their counts
