Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/152
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def compare(game,guess):
    """I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]
    """

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: compare

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_152.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:41:24 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:41:27 ---
Now let me understand the problem and develop a solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:41:29 ---
  command:
    / The task is to compute absolute differences between two arrays
    / If guess matches score, return 0, otherwise return abs(score - guess)
    
    / Let's test with the examples first
    game1: 1 2 3 4 5 1;
    guess1: 1 2 3 4 2 -2;
    abs game1 - guess1

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:41:29 ---
List_Int64([0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3])

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:41:33 ---
Perfect! Let me verify with the second example:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:41:33 ---
  command:
    game2: 0 5 0 0 0 4;
    guess2: 4 1 1 0 0 -2;
    abs game2 - guess2

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 07:41:34 ---
List_Int64([4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6])

--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:41:37 ---
Excellent! The solution is straightforward - just compute the absolute difference between the two arrays. Let me create the function:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:41:38 ---
  command:
    compare: {[game;guess] abs game - guess};
    compare[1 2 3 4 5 1; 1 2 3 4 2 -2]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 07:41:38 ---
List_Int64([0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3])

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:41:41 ---
  command:
    compare[0 5 0 0 0 4; 4 1 1 0 0 -2]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 07:41:41 ---
List_Int64([4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6])

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:41:44 ---
Perfect! Both test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 16. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:41:46 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_152_q_session_13ef8f3e/problem_solution_152.q
  content:
    compare: {[game;guess] abs game - guess}
    

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:41:51 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_152.q`.

The implementation is a simple one-liner that leverages q's vectorized operations:
- `game - guess` performs element-wise subtraction
- `abs` computes the absolute value of each difference

This is idiomatic q code that handles the problem efficiently without any explicit loops.
