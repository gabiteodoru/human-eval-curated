Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/20
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List, Tuple


def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """ From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
    (2.0, 2.2)
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    (2.0, 2.0)
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: find_closest_elements

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_20.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

Now let me analyze the problem:
- Find two numbers from a list that are closest to each other
- Return them in order (smaller, larger)
- The list has at least 2 elements

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:59:30 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 26. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:59:32 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_20_q_session_06991c75/problem_solution_20.q
  content:
    find_closest_elements: {[numbers]
        sorted: asc numbers;
        diffs: 1_ deltas sorted;
        minIdx: diffs?min diffs;
        sorted[minIdx + 0 1]
        };
    

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:59:39 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_20.q`.

**How it works:**
1. Sort the numbers using `asc`
2. Calculate differences between consecutive elements with `deltas` (dropping first element which is the original value)
3. Find the index of the minimum difference using `?` (find operator)
4. Return the pair at that index using vectorized indexing `sorted[minIdx + 0 1]`

The solution is fully vectorized and idiomatic q, leveraging built-in functions like `asc`, `deltas`, `min`, and vector arithmetic.
