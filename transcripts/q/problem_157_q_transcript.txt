Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/157
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: right_angle_triangle

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_157.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:43:54 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:43:57 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. For a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem must hold: a² + b² = c² (where c is the longest side). I need to check all three permutations since we don't know which side is the hypotenuse.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:43:59 ---
  command:
    right_angle_triangle: {[a;b;c] any (a*a)=(b*b)+c*c; (b*b)=(a*a)+c*c; (c*c)=(a*a)+b*b}

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:43:59 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:44:01 ---
  command:
    right_angle_triangle[3;4;5]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 07:44:01 ---
True

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:44:04 ---
  command:
    right_angle_triangle[1;2;3]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 07:44:04 ---
False

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:44:07 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more cases to ensure correctness:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:44:07 ---
  command:
    right_angle_triangle[5;3;4]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 07:44:07 ---
False

--- 14. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:44:12 ---
Let me fix that - I need to check all permutations properly:

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:44:12 ---
  command:
    right_angle_triangle: {[a;b;c] any ((a*a)=(b*b)+c*c; (b*b)=(a*a)+c*c; (c*c)=(a*a)+b*b)}

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 07:44:12 ---
None

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:44:15 ---
  command:
    right_angle_triangle[3;4;5]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 07:44:15 ---
True

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:44:18 ---
  command:
    right_angle_triangle[5;3;4]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 07:44:18 ---
True

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:44:20 ---
  command:
    right_angle_triangle[1;2;3]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 07:44:20 ---
False

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:44:22 ---
  command:
    right_angle_triangle[5;12;13]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 07:44:22 ---
True

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:44:25 ---
Great! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 26. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:44:28 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_157_q_session_3ba35ff2/problem_solution_157.q
  content:
    right_angle_triangle: {[a;b;c] any ((a*a)=(b*b)+c*c; (b*b)=(a*a)+c*c; (c*c)=(a*a)+b*b)};
    

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:44:32 ---
Perfect! The solution is complete. The function checks if any of the three possible permutations of the Pythagorean theorem holds (since we don't know which side is the hypotenuse). It uses q's `any` function with a list of three boolean conditions to determine if the sides form a right-angled triangle.
