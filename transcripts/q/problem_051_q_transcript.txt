Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/51
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes string and returns string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
    'bcdf\nghjklm'
    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
    'bcdf'
    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
    'B'
    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
    'zbcd'
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: remove_vowels

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_51.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEal problem by implementing a `remove_vowels` function in q/kdb+. Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:29:53 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:29:56 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. The function should remove all vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) from the input string.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:29:57 ---
  command:
    / Define the vowels to remove
    vowels: "aeiouAEIOU"

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:29:57 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:30:01 ---
  command:
    / Define the remove_vowels function
    remove_vowels: {[text] text where not text in "aeiouAEIOU"}

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:30:01 ---
None

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:30:04 ---
Now let me test with the provided examples:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:30:04 ---
  command:
    / Test 1: empty string
    remove_vowels[""]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:30:04 ---
String("")

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:30:09 ---
  command:
    / Test 2: string with newline
    remove_vowels["abcdef
    ghijklm"]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 23:30:09 ---
String("bcdf
ghjklm")

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:30:12 ---
  command:
    / Test 3: simple string
    remove_vowels["abcdef"]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:30:12 ---
String("bcdf")

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:30:15 ---
  command:
    / Test 4: all vowels
    remove_vowels["aaaaa"]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:30:15 ---
String("")

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:30:19 ---
  command:
    / Test 5: mixed case
    remove_vowels["aaBAA"]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 23:30:19 ---
String("B")

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:30:22 ---
  command:
    / Test 6: no vowels
    remove_vowels["zbcd"]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 23:30:22 ---
String("zbcd")

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:30:23 ---
Perfect! All tests pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 23. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:30:26 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_51_q_session_8321a728/problem_solution_51.q
  content:
    remove_vowels: {[text] text where not text in "aeiouAEIOU"};
    

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:30:31 ---
Done! I've implemented the `remove_vowels` function in q/kdb+. The solution uses a vectorized approach:

- `text in "aeiouAEIOU"` creates a boolean vector indicating which characters are vowels
- `not` negates this to identify non-vowels
- `where` filters to keep only the non-vowel characters

All test cases pass successfully.
