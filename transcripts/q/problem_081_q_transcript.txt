Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

Problem HumanEval/81
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    """It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
    to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
             GPA       |    Letter grade
              4.0                A+
            > 3.7                A 
            > 3.3                A- 
            > 3.0                B+
            > 2.7                B 
            > 2.3                B-
            > 2.0                C+
            > 1.7                C
            > 1.3                C-
            > 1.0                D+ 
            > 0.7                D 
            > 0.0                D-
              0.0                E
    

    Example:
    grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: numerical_letter_grade

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_81.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:58:14 ---
Now let me analyze the problem and develop a solution:

1. We need to map GPA values to letter grades based on thresholds
2. The mapping is: 4.0→A+, >3.7→A, >3.3→A-, >3.0→B+, >2.7→B, >2.3→B-, >2.0→C+, >1.7→C, >1.3→C-, >1.0→D+, >0.7→D, >0.0→D-, 0.0→E

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:58:21 ---
I need to fix the variable name - I should use `grades` not `x` in the conditional, or use a proper each iteration. Let me create a helper function:

Good! The output is correct but I notice inconsistency - some are String and some are Char. Let me check the test case more carefully. The expected output is `['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']` which should all be strings. Let me ensure all outputs are consistent strings:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:58:35 ---

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:58:41 ---
Now all are strings, but I have extra spaces. Looking at the Python example again: `['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']` - single letter grades should NOT have trailing spaces. Let me fix this by trimming:

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:58:43 ---
  command:
    gradeOne: {[gpa]
      rtrim $[gpa=4.0; "A+";
        gpa>3.7; "A ";
        gpa>3.3; "A-";
        gpa>3.0; "B+";
        gpa>2.7; "B ";
        gpa>2.3; "B-";
        gpa>2.0; "C+";
        gpa>1.7; "C ";
        gpa>1.3; "C-";
        gpa>1.0; "D+";
        gpa>0.7; "D ";
        gpa>0.0; "D-";
        "E "]
      };

List_Untyped([String("A+"), String("B"), String("C-"), String("C"), String("A-")])

Perfect! Now let me test a few edge cases:

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:58:48 ---
  command:
    numerical_letter_grade[4.0]

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 23:58:48 ---
String("A+")

--- 29. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:58:48 ---
  command:
    numerical_letter_grade[0.0]

--- 30. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #29) at 23:58:48 ---
String("E")

--- 31. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:58:52 ---

--- 33. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:58:55 ---
Excellent! All tests pass. Now let me write the solution to the file. I need to include both the helper function and the main function:

        "E "]
      };
    
    numerical_letter_grade: {[grades] gradeOne each grades};
    

--- 35. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:59:05 ---
Perfect! I've successfully solved HumanEval problem 81. The solution:

- **`gradeOne`**: Helper function that maps a single GPA value to its letter grade using q's conditional `$[...]` syntax
- **`numerical_letter_grade`**: Main function that applies `gradeOne` to each element in the grades list using `each`

The solution handles all the grade thresholds correctly and uses `rtrim` to ensure single-letter grades (A, B, C, D, E) don't have trailing spaces, matching the expected output format.
