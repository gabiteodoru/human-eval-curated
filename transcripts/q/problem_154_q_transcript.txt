Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/154
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def cycpattern_check(a , b):
    """You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word
    cycpattern_check("abcd","abd") => False
    cycpattern_check("hello","ell") => True
    cycpattern_check("whassup","psus") => False
    cycpattern_check("abab","baa") => True
    cycpattern_check("efef","eeff") => False
    cycpattern_check("himenss","simen") => True

    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: cycpattern_check

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_154.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and understand the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 10:10:26 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:10:29 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- Given two strings `a` and `b`
- Need to check if `b` or any rotation of `b` is a substring of `a`
- A rotation means shifting characters (e.g., "abc" rotations are "abc", "bca", "cab")

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:10:31 ---
  command:
    / First, let's understand rotations
    b: "ell";
    rotations: {x rotate\: til count x};
    rotations[b]

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 10:10:31 ---

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:10:37 ---
Good! Now let me check if any rotation is a substring:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:10:38 ---
  command:
    / Check if any rotation is a substring
    a: "hello";
    b: "ell";
    rotations: {(til count x) rotate\: x};
    rots: rotations[b];
    / Use ss (string search) to find substring
    any rots like\: a

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 10:10:38 ---
False

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:10:42 ---
  command:
    / like is for pattern matching, not substring. Use ss (string search)
    a: "hello";
    b: "ell";
    rotations: {(til count x) rotate\: x};
    rots: rotations[b];
    / ss returns positions where pattern found, empty list if not found
    any {count ss[x;y]} [a;] each rots

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 10:10:43 ---
True

--- 14. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:10:45 ---
Great! Let me create the complete function and test it with all examples:

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:10:47 ---
  command:
    cycpattern_check: {[a;b]
      rotations: (til count b) rotate\: b;
      any {count ss[x;y]} [a;] each rotations
     };
    cycpattern_check["abcd";"abd"]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 10:10:47 ---
False

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:10:50 ---
  command:
    cycpattern_check["hello";"ell"]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 10:10:50 ---
True

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:10:52 ---
  command:
    cycpattern_check["whassup";"psus"]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 10:10:52 ---
False

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:10:55 ---
  command:
    cycpattern_check["abab";"baa"]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 10:10:55 ---
True

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:10:58 ---
  command:
    cycpattern_check["efef";"eeff"]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 10:10:58 ---
False

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:11:00 ---
  command:
    cycpattern_check["himenss";"simen"]

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 10:11:00 ---
True

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:11:03 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to a file:

--- 28. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 10:11:05 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_154_q_session_5f263851/problem_solution_154.q
  content:
    cycpattern_check: {[a;b]
      rotations: (til count b) rotate\: b;
      any {count ss[x;y]} [a;] each rotations
     };
    

--- 29. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:11:09 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_154.q`.

The function:
- Generates all rotations of string `b` using `(til count b) rotate\: b`
- Checks if any rotation is a substring of `a` using `ss` (string search)
- Returns `1b` (true) if any rotation is found, `0b` (false) otherwise

All test cases pass successfully.
