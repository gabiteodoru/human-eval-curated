Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/110
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
    Otherwise, return "NO".
    For example:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: exchange

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_110.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 10:11:20 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:11:24 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- We need to determine if we can exchange elements between lst1 and lst2 to make lst1 contain only even numbers
- The key insight: we can exchange any number of elements, so we just need enough even numbers in the combined lists to fill lst1

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:11:25 ---
  command:
    / Test understanding: count total even numbers in both lists
    lst1: 1 2 3 4;
    lst2: 1 2 3 4;
    totalEven: sum (lst1,lst2) mod 2 = 0;
    totalEven

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 10:11:25 ---
0

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:11:28 ---
  command:
    / Fix: use 'not' for evenness check
    lst1: 1 2 3 4;
    lst2: 1 2 3 4;
    totalEven: sum not (lst1,lst2) mod 2;
    totalEven

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 10:11:28 ---
Int32(4)

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:11:32 ---
  command:
    / Check if we have enough evens to fill lst1
    lst1: 1 2 3 4;
    lst2: 1 2 3 4;
    totalEven: sum not (lst1,lst2) mod 2;
    needed: count lst1;
    totalEven >= needed

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 10:11:32 ---
True

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:11:35 ---
  command:
    / Now create the function
    exchange: {[lst1;lst2]
      totalEven: sum not (lst1,lst2) mod 2;
      needed: count lst1;
      $[totalEven >= needed; "YES"; "NO"]
      };
    exchange[1 2 3 4; 1 2 3 4]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 10:11:36 ---
String("YES")

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:11:39 ---
  command:
    / Test with the second example
    exchange[1 2 3 4; 1 5 3 4]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 10:11:39 ---
String("NO")

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:11:42 ---
  command:
    / Verify the logic for second example
    lst1: 1 2 3 4;
    lst2: 1 5 3 4;
    totalEven: sum not (lst1,lst2) mod 2;
    needed: count lst1;
    (totalEven; needed)

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 10:11:42 ---
List_Untyped([Int32(3), 4])

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:11:45 ---
Perfect! The logic is correct. Let me test a few more edge cases:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:11:46 ---
  command:
    / Test: all evens
    exchange[2 4 6; 8 10 12]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 10:11:46 ---
String("YES")

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:11:48 ---
  command:
    / Test: all odds
    exchange[1 3 5; 7 9 11]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 10:11:49 ---
String("NO")

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:11:53 ---
  command:
    / Test: single element lists
    exchange[enlist 1; enlist 2]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 10:11:53 ---
String("YES")

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:11:55 ---
  command:
    / Test: single odd element lists
    exchange[enlist 1; enlist 3]

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 10:11:55 ---
String("NO")

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:11:58 ---
Great! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 27. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 10:12:01 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_110_q_session_5670a5e8/problem_solution_110.q
  content:
    exchange: {[lst1;lst2]
      totalEven: sum not (lst1,lst2) mod 2;
      needed: count lst1;
      $[totalEven >= needed; "YES"; "NO"]
      }
    

--- 28. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:12:05 ---
Perfect! The solution is complete. 

The q implementation:
- Concatenates both lists and counts total even numbers using vectorized operations: `sum not (lst1,lst2) mod 2`
- Compares this count with the length of lst1
- Returns "YES" if we have enough evens, "NO" otherwise

This leverages q's strengths: vectorized modulo operation, boolean arithmetic, and concise conditional syntax.
