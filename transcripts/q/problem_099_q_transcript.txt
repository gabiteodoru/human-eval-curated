Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/99
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def closest_integer(value):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
    from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Examples
    >>> closest_integer("10")
    10
    >>> closest_integer("15.3")
    15

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should
    return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: closest_integer

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_99.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll help you solve this HumanEval problem in q/kdb+. Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

Perfect! The solution is working correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 38. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:54:34 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_99_q_session_e5ba0ff6/problem_solution_99.q
  content:
    closest_integer: {[val]
      n: value val;
      f: floor n;
      frac: n - f;
      $[frac = 0.5;
        $[n >= 0; f + 1; f];
        $[frac < 0.5; f; f + 1]
      ]
     };
    

--- 39. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:54:42 ---
Solution complete! The `closest_integer` function:

1. Converts the string to a number using `value`
2. Computes the floor and fractional part
3. If fractional part is exactly 0.5, rounds away from zero (up for positive, down for negative)
4. Otherwise, rounds normally (down if < 0.5, up if > 0.5)

The solution has been written to `problem_solution_99.q`.
