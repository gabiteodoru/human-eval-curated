Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/13
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: greatest_common_divisor

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_13.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this step by step, implementing the greatest common divisor function in q/kdb+.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 22:51:19 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:51:22 ---
Now let me develop and test the greatest common divisor function. I'll use the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient and idiomatic in q:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:51:23 ---
  command:
    greatest_common_divisor: {[a;b] $[b=0; a; .z.s[b; a mod b]]};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:51:23 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:51:30 ---
Now let me test it with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:51:30 ---
  command:
    greatest_common_divisor[3;5]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 22:51:30 ---
1

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:51:34 ---
  command:
    greatest_common_divisor[25;15]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 22:51:34 ---
5

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:51:36 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more cases to ensure robustness:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:51:37 ---
  command:
    greatest_common_divisor[100;50]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 22:51:37 ---
50

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:51:36 ---
  command:
    greatest_common_divisor[17;19]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 22:51:36 ---
1

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:51:39 ---
Excellent! The function works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 18. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:51:41 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_13_q_session_1f65a65d/problem_solution_13.q
  content:
    greatest_common_divisor: {[a;b] $[b=0; a; .z.s[b; a mod b]]};
    

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:51:46 ---
Done! The solution implements the Euclidean algorithm using q's recursive self-reference (`.z.s`) and conditional operator (`$[condition; true_result; false_result]`). The algorithm recursively computes `gcd(b, a mod b)` until `b=0`, at which point `a` is the GCD.
