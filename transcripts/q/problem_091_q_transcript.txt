Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/91
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: is_bored

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_91.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 00:09:36 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:09:39 ---
Now let's analyze the problem:
- Count sentences that start with "I"
- Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'
- We need to split by these delimiters and check if each sentence starts with "I"

Let me develop the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:09:41 ---
  command:
    / Test string splitting by delimiters
    s: "The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather";
    s

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 00:09:41 ---
String("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:09:44 ---
  command:
    / Replace delimiters with a single one, then split
    s: "The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather";
    / Replace ? and ! with .

    s1

Let me reconsider the trimming approach - I need to trim leading/trailing spaces, not remove all spaces:

    trimmed: ltrim each sentences;
    trimmed

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 53. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 00:10:54 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_91_q_session_dca883d7/problem_solution_91.q
  content:
    is_bored: {s: ssr[ssr[x;"?";"."];"!";"."]; sentences: "." vs s; trimmed: {(0|first where not x=" ") _ x} each sentences; sum "I"={first x} each trimmed}
    

--- 54. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:10:58 ---
Solution complete! The `is_bored` function:
1. Replaces `?` and `!` with `.` to normalize sentence delimiters
2. Splits the string by `.` to get sentences
3. Trims leading spaces from each sentence
4. Counts how many sentences start with "I"
