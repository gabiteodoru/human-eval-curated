Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/151
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: double_the_difference

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_151.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:40:23 ---
Now let me understand the requirements:
1. Sum the squares of odd numbers only
2. Ignore negative numbers
3. Ignore non-integers (decimals)
4. Return 0 for empty list

Let me develop and test the solution:

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 28. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:41:06 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_151_q_session_510c7390/problem_solution_151.q
  content:
    double_the_difference: {[lst]
      if[0=count lst; :0];
      / Filter: positive, integer, and odd
      valid: (lst > 0) & (lst = floor lst) & (1 = lst mod 2);
      / Sum of squares of valid numbers
      sum (lst * lst) * valid
      };
    

--- 29. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:41:12 ---
Solution complete! The function `double_the_difference` uses vectorized q operations to:
1. Check if list is empty and return 0
2. Create a boolean filter combining three conditions: positive (`lst > 0`), integer (`lst = floor lst`), and odd (`1 = lst mod 2`)
3. Sum the squares of numbers multiplied by the filter mask

All test cases pass: [1,3,2,0]→10, [-1,-2,0]→0, [9,-2]→81, [0]→0, and empty list→0.
