Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/90
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def next_smallest(lst):
    """
    You are given a list of integers.
    Write a function next_smallest() that returns the 2nd smallest element of the list.
    Return None if there is no such element.
    
    next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2
    next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]) == 2
    next_smallest([]) == None
    next_smallest([1, 1]) == None
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: next_smallest

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_90.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

--- 30. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:09:20 ---
Excellent! All tests pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 31. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 00:09:22 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_90_q_session_d04549c9/problem_solution_90.q
  content:
    next_smallest: {[lst]
      distinct_sorted: asc distinct lst;
      $[2 <= count distinct_sorted; distinct_sorted[1]; 0N]
      }
    

--- 32. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:09:27 ---
Perfect! The solution is complete. 

The `next_smallest` function:
1. Gets distinct values from the input list using `distinct`
2. Sorts them in ascending order using `asc`
3. Checks if there are at least 2 distinct elements
4. Returns the element at index 1 (2nd smallest) if yes, otherwise returns `0N` (null integer)

The solution leverages q's vectorized operations and handles all edge cases including empty lists, single elements, and lists with all identical values.
