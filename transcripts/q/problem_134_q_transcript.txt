Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/134
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    '''
    Create a function that returns True if the last character
    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
    a part of a word, and False otherwise.
    Note: "word" is a group of characters separated by space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") ➞ True
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") ➞ False 
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: check_if_last_char_is_a_letter

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_134.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:25:05 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:25:08 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- Return True if the last character is alphabetical AND not part of a word (i.e., preceded by a space)
- Return False otherwise
- Words are separated by spaces

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:25:11 ---
  command:
    / First, let's understand the test cases
    / "apple pie" - last char is 'e', part of word "pie" -> False
    / "apple pi e" - last char is 'e', preceded by space -> True  
    / "apple pi e " - last char is ' ', not alphabetical -> False
    / "" - empty string -> False
    
    / Helper to check if a character is alphabetical
    isAlpha:{x in .Q.A,.Q.a};
    
    / Test the helper
    isAlpha each "abc123XYZ ";

Good! Now let me implement the main function:

  command:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter:{[txt]

      if[0=count txt; :0b];
      / Get last character
      lastChar:last txt;
      / Check if last char is alphabetical
      if[not lastChar in .Q.A,.Q.a; :0b];
      / If string has only 1 char, it's not part of a word (standalone)
      if[1=count txt; :1b];
      / Check if second-to-last char is a space (meaning last char is not part of a word)
      (last -2#txt)=" "
     };

--- 68. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:26:56 ---
Solution complete! The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` has been written to `problem_solution_134.q`.

The implementation:
1. Returns `0b` (False) for empty strings
2. Checks if the last character is alphabetical using `.Q.A,.Q.a` (all uppercase and lowercase letters)
3. Returns `1b` (True) for single-letter strings (standalone letter)
4. For strings with 2+ characters, returns True only if the second-to-last character is a space (meaning the last letter is not part of a word)
