Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/150
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """A simple program which should return the value of x if n is 
    a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.

    Examples:
    for x_or_y(7, 34, 12) == 34
    for x_or_y(15, 8, 5) == 5
    
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: x_or_y

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_150.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll help you solve this HumanEal problem in q/kdb+. Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop a solution to check if a number is prime and return x or y accordingly.

--- 49. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:40:06 ---
Solution complete! I've created `problem_solution_150.q` with:

1. **isPrime helper function** - checks if a number is prime by:
   - Returning false for n < 2
   - Returning true for n = 2
   - Returning false for even numbers
   - Testing odd divisors from 3 up to âˆšn

2. **x_or_y function** - returns x if n is prime, otherwise returns y

Both test cases pass:
- `x_or_y[7; 34; 12]` returns `34` (7 is prime)
- `x_or_y[15; 8; 5]` returns `5` (15 is not prime)
