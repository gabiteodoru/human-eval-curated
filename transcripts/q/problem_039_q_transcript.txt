Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/39
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def prime_fib(n: int):
    """
    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.
    >>> prime_fib(1)
    2
    >>> prime_fib(2)
    3
    >>> prime_fib(3)
    5
    >>> prime_fib(4)

    >>> prime_fib(5)
    89
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: prime_fib

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_39.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step. Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop a solution for finding the n-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and prime.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:16:43 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:16:47 ---
Now let me develop the solution. I need to:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Generate Fibonacci numbers
3. Find the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime

Let me start by creating a prime checking function:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:16:49 ---
  command:
    isPrime: {[x] if[x<2; :0b]; if[x=2; :1b]; if[0=x mod 2; :0b]; all x mod/: 2+til floor sqrt x};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:16:49 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:16:51 ---
  command:
    isPrime 2

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:16:51 ---
True

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:16:53 ---
  command:
    isPrime each 2 3 5 7 11 13

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 23:16:53 ---
List_Bool([True, True, True, True, True, True])

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:16:56 ---
  command:
    isPrime each 4 6 8 9 10

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 23:16:56 ---
List_Bool([False, False, False, False, False])

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:17:00 ---
Good! Now let me create the main `prime_fib` function that generates Fibonacci numbers and finds the n-th one that is prime:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:17:01 ---
  command:
    prime_fib: {[n] a:0; b:1; count:0; while[count<n; c:a+b; a:b; b:c; if[isPrime[b]; count+:1]]; b};

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:17:01 ---
Error: assign
Trace:
  [3]  prime_fib: {[n] a:0; b:1; count:0; while[count<n; c:a+b; a:b; b:c; if[isPrime[b]; count+:1]]; b};
                                      ^


--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:17:04 ---
I need to use local variables properly. Let me fix this:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:17:04 ---
  command:
    prime_fib: {[n] a:0; b:1; count:0; while[count<n; c:a+b; a::b; b::c; if[isPrime[b]; count+:1]]; b};

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 23:17:05 ---
Error: assign
Trace:
  [3]  prime_fib: {[n] a:0; b:1; count:0; while[count<n; c:a+b; a::b; b::c; if[isPrime[b]; count+:1]]; b};
                                      ^


--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:17:07 ---
Let me use a different approach with proper local variable handling in q:

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:17:10 ---
  command:
    prime_fib: {[n] fib:{x,sum -2#x}/[{2>sum isPrime each x};0 1]; last fib where isPrime each fib};

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 23:17:10 ---
None

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:17:10 ---
Wait, that approach won't work correctly. Let me think about this differently - I'll generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively and check which ones are prime:

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:17:11 ---
  command:
    prime_fib: {[n] a:0; b:1; cnt:0; while[cnt<n; tmp:a+b; a:b; b:tmp; if[isPrime b; cnt+:1]]; b};

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 23:17:11 ---
None

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:17:14 ---
Good! Now let me test this with the examples:

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:17:14 ---
  command:
    prime_fib 1

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 23:17:14 ---
2

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:17:17 ---
  command:
    prime_fib 2

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 23:17:17 ---
3

--- 30. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:17:19 ---
  command:
    prime_fib 3

--- 31. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #30) at 23:17:19 ---
5

--- 32. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:17:22 ---
  command:
    prime_fib 4

--- 33. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #32) at 23:17:22 ---
13

--- 34. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:17:25 ---
  command:
    prime_fib 5

--- 35. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #34) at 23:17:25 ---
89

--- 36. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:17:28 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 37. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:17:32 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_39_q_session_f74b8ec0/problem_solution_39.q
  content:
    isPrime: {[x] if[x<2; :0b]; if[x=2; :1b]; if[0=x mod 2; :0b]; all x mod/: 2+til floor sqrt x};
    
    prime_fib: {[n] a:0; b:1; cnt:0; while[cnt<n; tmp:a+b; a:b; b:tmp; if[isPrime b; cnt+:1]]; b};
    

--- 38. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:17:37 ---
Solution complete! The implementation includes:

1. **`isPrime`** - Helper function that checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. **`prime_fib`** - Main function that generates Fibonacci numbers iteratively and counts only those that are prime, returning the n-th prime Fibonacci number

The solution correctly handles all test cases:
- `prime_fib(1)` → 2
- `prime_fib(2)` → 3
- `prime_fib(3)` → 5
- `prime_fib(4)` → 13
- `prime_fib(5)` → 89
