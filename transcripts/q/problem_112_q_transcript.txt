Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/112
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def reverse_delete(s,c):
    """Task
    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    then check if the result string is palindrome.
    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
    Example
    For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ('bcd',False)
    For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ('acdef',False)
    For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ('cdedc',True)
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: reverse_delete

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_112.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 08:04:43 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:04:47 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. The task is to:
1. Delete all characters in `s` that are in `c`
2. Check if the result is a palindrome
3. Return a tuple (result string, is_palindrome boolean)

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:04:48 ---
  command:
    / First, let's understand string operations in q
    s: "abcde";
    c: "ae";
    / Remove characters: keep only those NOT in c
    result: s where not s in c;
    result

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 08:04:48 ---
String("bcd")

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:04:52 ---
  command:
    / Check if a string is a palindrome by reversing it
    s: "bcd";
    isPalindrome: s~reverse s;
    isPalindrome

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 08:04:52 ---
False

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:04:54 ---
  command:
    / Test with a palindrome
    s: "cdedc";
    isPalindrome: s~reverse s;
    isPalindrome

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 08:04:54 ---
True

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:04:57 ---
Perfect! Now let me create the complete function:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:04:58 ---
  command:
    reverse_delete: {[s;c]
      result: s where not s in c;
      (result; result~reverse result)
      };

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 08:04:58 ---
None

--- 14. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:05:00 ---
Now let me test the function with the provided examples:

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:05:01 ---
  command:
    / Test case 1: s = "abcde", c = "ae" -> ('bcd',False)
    reverse_delete["abcde"; "ae"]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 08:05:01 ---
List_Untyped([String("bcd"), False])

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:05:04 ---
  command:
    / Test case 2: s = "abcdef", c = "b" -> ('acdef',False)
    reverse_delete["abcdef"; "b"]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 08:05:04 ---
List_Untyped([String("acdef"), False])

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:05:07 ---
  command:
    / Test case 3: s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab" -> ('cdedc',True)
    reverse_delete["abcdedcba"; "ab"]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 08:05:07 ---
List_Untyped([String("cdedc"), True])

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:05:10 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 22. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:05:12 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_112_q_session_215d1823/problem_solution_112.q
  content:
    reverse_delete: {[s;c]
      result: s where not s in c;
      (result; result~reverse result)
      }
    

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:05:15 ---
Solution complete! The `reverse_delete` function:

1. **Removes characters**: Uses `s where not s in c` to filter out characters from `s` that appear in `c`
2. **Checks palindrome**: Uses `result~reverse result` to check if the string equals its reverse
3. **Returns tuple**: Returns a 2-element list with the result string and boolean

The implementation is idiomatic q, using vectorized operations without explicit loops.
