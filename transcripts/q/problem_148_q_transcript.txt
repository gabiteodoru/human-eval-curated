Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/148
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def bf(planet1, planet2):
    '''
    There are eight planets in our solar system: the closerst to the Sun 
    is Mercury, the next one is Venus, then Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, 
    Uranus, Neptune.
    Write a function that takes two planet names as strings planet1 and planet2. 
    The function should return a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are 
    located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2, sorted by 
    the proximity to the sun. 
    The function should return an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2
    are not correct planet names. 
    Examples
    bf("Jupiter", "Neptune") ==> ("Saturn", "Uranus")
    bf("Earth", "Mercury") ==> ("Venus")
    bf("Mercury", "Uranus") ==> ("Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn")
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: bf

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_148.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:00:07 ---
Now let me develop the solution. First, I'll create the function to find planets between two given planets:

    planets: `Mercury`Venus`Earth`Mars`Jupiter`Saturn`Uranus`Neptune

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:00:16 ---
Now let me test the function with the provided examples:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:00:17 ---
  command:
    bf[`Jupiter;`Neptune]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 10:00:17 ---

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:00:19 ---
Let me fix the issue. The problem is with how I'm checking the condition. Let me revise:

Let me debug this step by step:

I see the issue - `min` doesn't work that way in q. Let me use the correct syntax:

      if[diff<=1; :`$()];
      indices: ((i1&i2)+1) + til diff-1;
      planets indices
     }
    

--- 72. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:01:44 ---
Solution complete! The `bf` function:

1. Defines the 8 planets in solar system order
2. Finds the indices of both input planets using `?` (find)
3. Returns empty list if either planet is invalid (index >= count planets)
4. Returns empty list if planets are same or adjacent (diff <= 1)
5. Uses vectorized operations to get planets between them: `((i1&i2)+1) + til diff-1`
6. Returns the list sorted by proximity to sun (naturally ordered by index)
