Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/60
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: sum_to_n

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_60.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEal problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:37:30 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:37:34 ---
Now, let me develop and test the solution. In q, summing numbers from 1 to n can be done efficiently using the mathematical formula `n*(n+1)%2` or by using vectorized operations with `sum til n+1`.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:37:35 ---
  command:
    sum_to_n: {sum 1+til x}

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:37:35 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:37:38 ---
Now let's test it with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:37:38 ---
  command:
    sum_to_n[30]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:37:38 ---
465

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:37:41 ---
  command:
    sum_to_n[100]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:37:41 ---
5050

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:37:44 ---
  command:
    sum_to_n[5]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 23:37:44 ---
15

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:37:44 ---
  command:
    sum_to_n[10]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:37:44 ---
55

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:37:47 ---
  command:
    sum_to_n[1]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:37:47 ---
1

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:37:51 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 19. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:37:53 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_60_q_session_57091d90/problem_solution_60.q
  content:
    sum_to_n: {sum 1+til x};
    

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:37:57 ---
Solution complete! The function uses idiomatic q:
- `til x` generates integers from 0 to x-1
- `1+til x` shifts to 1 to x
- `sum` efficiently sums all values

All test cases verified successfully.
