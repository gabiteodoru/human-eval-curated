Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/72
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def will_it_fly(q,w):
    '''
    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.

    Example:
    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) ➞ False 
    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) ➞ False
    # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) ➞ True
    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.

    will_it_fly([3], 5) ➞ True
    # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
    '''

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: will_it_fly

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_72.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:49:02 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:49:05 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. The function needs to:
1. Check if the list is palindromic (balanced)
2. Check if the sum is <= the maximum weight w
3. Return true only if both conditions are met

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:49:06 ---
  command:
    will_it_fly: {[q;w] (q~reverse q) and (sum[q] <= w)}

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:49:07 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:49:09 ---
Now let's test with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:49:10 ---
  command:
    will_it_fly[1 2; 5]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:49:10 ---
False

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:49:12 ---
  command:
    will_it_fly[3 2 3; 1]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:49:12 ---
False

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:49:15 ---
  command:
    will_it_fly[3 2 3; 9]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 23:49:15 ---
True

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:49:18 ---
  command:
    will_it_fly[enlist 3; 5]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:49:19 ---
True

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:49:22 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me test a few edge cases:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:49:22 ---
  command:
    will_it_fly[`long$(); 0]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 23:49:22 ---
True

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:49:25 ---
  command:
    will_it_fly[1 2 3 2 1; 10]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 23:49:25 ---
True

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:49:27 ---
  command:
    will_it_fly[1 2 3 2 1; 5]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 23:49:27 ---
False

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:49:30 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 24. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:49:31 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_72_q_session_f0f320bb/problem_solution_72.q
  content:
    will_it_fly: {[q;w] (q~reverse q) and (sum[q] <= w)}
    

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:49:34 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_72.q`.

The implementation uses:
- `q~reverse q` to check if the list is palindromic (balanced)
- `sum[q] <= w` to check if the sum is within the weight limit
- `and` to combine both conditions

All test cases pass successfully.
