Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/123
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: get_odd_collatz

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_123.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution.

Now let me develop the Collatz sequence function. The algorithm is:
1. Start with n
2. If even: divide by 2
3. If odd: multiply by 3 and add 1
4. Continue until reaching 1
5. Filter odd numbers and sort

      seq
    };

Query taking longer than 1s, switched to async mode. Will auto-interrupt after 10s. Use get_current_task_result() to wait for completion.

Let me interrupt and fix the logic error:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__interrupt_current_query (Message #1) at 09:52:12 ---
  (no parameters)

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:52:15 ---
I see the issue - there's a logic error. Let me fix it:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:52:16 ---
  command:
    / Fix: when odd, it's 3*n+1, not 3*(n+1)
    collatz: {[n]
      seq: enlist n;
      while[n > 1;
        n: $[n mod 2; (3*n)+1; n div 2];
        seq,: n
      ];
      seq
    };

Perfect! Now let me create the function to get odd numbers from the Collatz sequence and sort them:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:52:23 ---
  command:
    / Create the get_odd_collatz function
    get_odd_collatz: {[n]

      asc distinct seq where seq mod 2
    };

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 09:52:23 ---

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:52:28 ---
Excellent! Let me test with a few more cases:

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:52:28 ---
  command:
    / Test edge case: n=1
    get_odd_collatz[1]

    / HumanEval/123: Get odd numbers from Collatz sequence
    
    / Helper function to generate Collatz sequence
    collatz: {[n]

        n: $[n mod 2; (3*n)+1; n div 2];

    get_odd_collatz: {[n]
      seq: collatz[n];
      asc distinct seq where seq mod 2
    };
    

--- 33. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:52:50 ---
Solution complete! The implementation:

1. **`collatz` helper function**: Generates the Collatz sequence by iterating until reaching 1
   - If n is odd (`n mod 2`): next value is `3*n + 1`
   - If n is even: next value is `n div 2`

2. **`get_odd_collatz` main function**: 
   - Generates the sequence using `collatz[n]`
   - Filters odd numbers using `where seq mod 2`
   - Returns distinct, sorted values using `asc distinct`

Tested with examples: `get_odd_collatz[5]` returns `[1, 5]` as expected.
