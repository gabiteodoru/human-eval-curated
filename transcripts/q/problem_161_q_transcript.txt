Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/161
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def solve(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, 
    otherwise keep it as it is.
    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
    The function should return the resulted string.
    Examples
    solve("1234") = "4321"
    solve("ab") = "AB"
    solve("#a@C") = "#A@c"
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: solve

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_161.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 10:03:28 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:03:32 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
1. For each character: if it's a letter, reverse its case (lower↔upper)
2. If not a letter, keep it as is
3. Special case: if the string contains NO letters at all, reverse the entire string
4. Return the modified string

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:03:34 ---
  command:
    solve:{[s]
      hasLetters: any (s within "az") | s within "AZ";
      $[hasLetters;
        {$[x within "az"; upper x; x within "AZ"; lower x; x]} each s;
        reverse s
      ]
     }

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 10:03:34 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:03:37 ---
  command:
    solve["1234"]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 10:03:37 ---
String("4321")

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:03:39 ---
  command:
    solve["ab"]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 10:03:39 ---
String("AB")

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:03:41 ---
  command:
    solve["#a@C"]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 10:03:41 ---
String("#A@c")

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:03:45 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me verify a few more edge cases:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:03:45 ---
  command:
    solve[""]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 10:03:45 ---
String("")

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:03:48 ---
  command:
    solve["123!@#"]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 10:03:48 ---
String("#@!321")

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 10:03:50 ---
  command:
    solve["Hello World!"]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 10:03:51 ---
String("hELLO wORLD!")

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:03:53 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 21. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 10:03:56 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_161_q_session_29d5ca99/problem_solution_161.q
  content:
    solve:{[s]
      hasLetters: any (s within "az") | s within "AZ";
      $[hasLetters;
        {$[x within "az"; upper x; x within "AZ"; lower x; x]} each s;
        reverse s
      ]
     }
    

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:04:01 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_161.q`.

The implementation:
- Checks if the string contains any letters using vectorized `within` operations
- If letters exist: maps over each character, toggling case for letters and preserving non-letters
- If no letters: reverses the entire string
- All test cases pass: `"1234"` → `"4321"`, `"ab"` → `"AB"`, `"#a@C"` → `"#A@c"`
