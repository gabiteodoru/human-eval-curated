Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/52
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def below_threshold(l: list, t: int):
    """Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t.
    >>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)
    True
    >>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)
    False
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: below_threshold

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_52.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:30:43 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:30:46 ---
Now let me develop the `below_threshold` function. The function should return true if all numbers in the list are below the threshold.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:30:47 ---
  command:
    below_threshold: {[l;t] all l < t};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:30:47 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:30:49 ---
Let me test this with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:30:50 ---
  command:
    below_threshold[1 2 4 10; 100]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:30:50 ---
True

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:30:52 ---
  command:
    below_threshold[1 20 4 10; 5]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:30:53 ---
False

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:30:52 ---
Perfect! Both test cases pass. Let me test a few edge cases:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:30:53 ---
  command:
    below_threshold[`long$(); 10]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 23:30:53 ---
True

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:30:56 ---
  command:
    below_threshold[1 2 3; 3]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 23:30:56 ---
False

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:30:59 ---
  command:
    below_threshold[1 2 3; 4]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 23:30:59 ---
True

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:31:03 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 20. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:31:05 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_52_q_session_990b7652/problem_solution_52.q
  content:
    below_threshold: {[l;t] all l < t}
    

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:31:09 ---
Done! The solution is a simple, idiomatic q function that:
- Uses vectorized comparison `l < t` to check each element
- Applies `all` to verify all elements satisfy the condition
- Returns a boolean (True/False)
