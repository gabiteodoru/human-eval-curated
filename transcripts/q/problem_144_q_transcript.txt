Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/144
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def simplify(x, n):
    """Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression
    x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False
    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,
    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.

    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.

    simplify("1/5", "5/1") = True
    simplify("1/6", "2/1") = False
    simplify("7/10", "10/2") = False
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: simplify

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_144.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:35:04 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:35:08 ---
Now let me develop the solution. The problem asks to:
1. Parse two fraction strings (format: "numerator/denominator")
2. Multiply the fractions
3. Check if the result is a whole number

Let me start by testing the parsing and logic:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:35:10 ---
  command:
    / Parse a fraction string and extract numerator and denominator
    parseFrac: {"J"$"/" vs x};
    parseFrac["1/5"]

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:35:10 ---
List_Int64([1, 5])

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:35:15 ---
  command:
    / Test fraction multiplication
    / x = a/b, n = c/d
    / x * n = (a*c)/(b*d)
    / whole number if (a*c) mod (b*d) = 0
    a: parseFrac["1/5"];
    b: parseFrac["5/1"];
    numerator: prd a[0],b[0];
    denominator: prd a[1],b[1];
    (numerator; denominator; 0 = numerator mod denominator)

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 07:35:15 ---
List_Untyped([5, 5, True])

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:35:20 ---
Great! Now let me create the complete function and test it with the examples:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:35:21 ---
  command:
    simplify: {[x;n]
      xf: "J"$"/" vs x;
      nf: "J"$"/" vs n;
      num: prd xf[0],nf[0];
      den: prd xf[1],nf[1];
      0 = num mod den
     };
    simplify["1/5"; "5/1"]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 07:35:22 ---
True

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:35:24 ---
  command:
    simplify["1/6"; "2/1"]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 07:35:24 ---
False

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:35:27 ---
  command:
    simplify["7/10"; "10/2"]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 07:35:27 ---
False

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:35:30 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me verify the logic once more with some additional tests:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:35:31 ---
  command:
    / Test: 2/3 * 3/2 = 6/6 = 1 (whole number)
    simplify["2/3"; "3/2"]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 07:35:31 ---
True

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:35:34 ---
  command:
    / Test: 4/8 * 2/1 = 8/8 = 1 (whole number)
    simplify["4/8"; "2/1"]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 07:35:34 ---
True

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:35:38 ---
Excellent! Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 22. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:35:40 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_144_q_session_08fce39a/problem_solution_144.q
  content:
    simplify: {[x;n]
      xf: "J"$"/" vs x;
      nf: "J"$"/" vs n;
      num: prd xf[0],nf[0];
      den: prd xf[1],nf[1];
      0 = num mod den
     }
    

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:35:46 ---
Perfect! I've successfully implemented the `simplify` function in native q/kdb+. 

The solution:
- Parses both fraction strings using `"/" vs` to split on "/" and `"J"$` to convert to long integers
- Calculates the numerator of the product as `xf[0] * nf[0]` 
- Calculates the denominator of the product as `xf[1] * nf[1]`
- Uses `prd` to multiply pairs of values
- Checks if the result is a whole number using `0 = num mod den`

All test cases pass: `simplify["1/5"; "5/1"]` returns `1b` (true), `simplify["1/6"; "2/1"]` returns `0b` (false), and `simplify["7/10"; "10/2"]` returns `0b` (false).
