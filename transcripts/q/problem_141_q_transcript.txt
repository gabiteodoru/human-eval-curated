Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/141
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: file_name_check

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_141.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 09:50:54 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:50:57 ---
Now let me analyze the requirements:
1. No more than 3 digits in the file name
2. Exactly one dot '.'
3. Substring before dot: not empty and starts with a letter (a-z or A-Z)
4. Substring after dot: must be one of ["txt", "exe", "dll"]

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:51:03 ---
  command:
    file_name_check: {[file_name]
      / Check if exactly one dot
      dotCount: sum "." = file_name;
      if[dotCount <> 1; :"No"];
      
      / Split by dot
      parts: "." vs file_name;
      name: parts 0;
      ext: parts 1;
      
      / Check if name is not empty
      if[0 = count name; :"No"];
      
      / Check if first character is a letter
      first_char: first name;
      if[not (first_char within "az") | (first_char within "AZ"); :"No"];
      
      / Check digit count (max 3)
      digitCount: sum file_name in "0123456789";
      if[digitCount > 3; :"No"];
      
      / Check extension
      if[not ext in ("txt"; "exe"; "dll"); :"No"];
      
      "Yes"
     };

None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:51:05 ---
Now let's test with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:51:06 ---
  command:
    file_name_check["example.txt"]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 09:51:06 ---
String("Yes")

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:51:08 ---
  command:
    file_name_check["1example.dll"]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 09:51:08 ---
String("No")

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:51:11 ---

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:51:31 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 28. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 09:51:38 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_141_q_session_9a2dc4ce/problem_solution_141.q
  content:
    file_name_check: {[file_name]
      / Check if exactly one dot
      dotCount: sum "." = file_name;
      if[dotCount <> 1; :"No"];
    
      / Split by dot
      parts: "." vs file_name;
      name: parts 0;
      ext: parts 1;
    
      / Check if name is not empty
      if[0 = count name; :"No"];
    
      / Check if first character is a letter
      first_char: first name;
      if[not (first_char within "az") | (first_char within "AZ"); :"No"];
    
      / Check digit count (max 3)
      digitCount: sum file_name in "0123456789";
      if[digitCount > 3; :"No"];
    
      / Check extension
      if[not ext in ("txt"; "exe"; "dll"); :"No"];
    
      "Yes"
     };
    

--- 29. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:51:41 ---
Solution written to `problem_solution_141.q`. The implementation validates file names by checking:
- Exactly one dot
- Non-empty prefix starting with a letter (a-z or A-Z)
- At most 3 digits total
- Extension is txt, exe, or dll
