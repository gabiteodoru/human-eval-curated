Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/143
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = "This is a test"
        Output: "is"

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"
        Output: "go for"

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
        * sentence contains only letters
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: words_in_sentence

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_143.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEal problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 09:50:01 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:50:03 ---
Now let me develop the solution. First, I need a helper function to check if a number is prime:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:50:05 ---
  command:
    isPrime: {[n] $[n<2; 0b; n=2; 1b; not any 0=n mod 2_til 1+floor sqrt n]}

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 09:50:05 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:50:08 ---
Let me test the isPrime function:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:50:09 ---
  command:
    isPrime each 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 09:50:09 ---
List_Bool([False, True, True, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True])

--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:50:11 ---
Great! Now let me implement the main function:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:50:13 ---
  command:
    words_in_sentence: {[sentence] words: " " vs sentence; primeWords: words where isPrime each count each words; " " sv primeWords}

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 09:50:13 ---
None

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:50:16 ---
Now let me test it with the provided examples:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:50:16 ---
  command:
    words_in_sentence["This is a test"]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 09:50:16 ---
String("is")

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:50:18 ---
  command:
    words_in_sentence["lets go for swimming"]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 09:50:18 ---
String("go for")

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:50:22 ---
Perfect! Both test cases pass. Let me verify the logic with a few more edge cases:

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:50:22 ---
  command:
    count each " " vs "This is a test"

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 09:50:22 ---
List_Int64([4, 2, 1, 4])

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:50:25 ---
  command:
    isPrime each 4 2 1 4

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 09:50:25 ---
List_Bool([False, True, False, False])

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:50:27 ---
  command:
    count each " " vs "lets go for swimming"

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 09:50:27 ---
List_Int64([4, 2, 3, 8])

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 09:50:30 ---
  command:
    isPrime each 4 2 3 8

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 09:50:30 ---
List_Bool([False, True, True, False])

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:50:33 ---
Excellent! The logic is correct. Now let me write the solution to a file:

--- 28. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 09:50:38 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_143_q_session_c95f981b/problem_solution_143.q
  content:
    / Helper function to check if a number is prime
    isPrime: {[n] $[n<2; 0b; n=2; 1b; not any 0=n mod 2_til 1+floor sqrt n]};
    
    / Main function to filter words with prime length
    words_in_sentence: {[sentence] words: " " vs sentence; primeWords: words where isPrime each count each words; " " sv primeWords};
    

--- 29. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:50:42 ---
Solution complete! The implementation:

1. **`isPrime`** - Checks if a number is prime:
   - Returns false for n < 2
   - Returns true for n = 2
   - For other numbers, checks divisibility from 2 up to sqrt(n)

2. **`words_in_sentence`** - Filters words by prime length:
   - Splits sentence by spaces using `" " vs sentence`
   - Filters words where their length is prime using vectorized operations
   - Joins filtered words back with spaces using `" " sv`

Both test cases pass correctly.
