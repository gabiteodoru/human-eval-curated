Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/139
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: special_factorial

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_139.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:32:39 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:32:43 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- The special (Brazilian) factorial is: n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
- For n=4: 4! * 3! * 2! * 1! = 24 * 6 * 2 * 1 = 288

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:32:44 ---
  command:
    / First, let's create a factorial helper function
    factorial: {prd 1+til x};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:32:44 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:32:47 ---
  command:
    / Test factorial
    factorial[4]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 07:32:47 ---
24

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:32:51 ---
  command:
    / Now create the special_factorial function
    / We need to compute factorial for each number from 1 to n, then multiply them all
    special_factorial: {prd factorial each 1+til x};

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 07:32:51 ---
None

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:32:54 ---
  command:
    / Test with the example: special_factorial(4) should be 288
    special_factorial[4]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 07:32:54 ---
288

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:32:57 ---
Great! Let me test a few more cases to ensure correctness:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:32:57 ---
  command:
    / Test edge cases
    special_factorial[1]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 07:32:57 ---
1

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:33:00 ---
  command:
    special_factorial[2]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 07:33:00 ---
2

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:33:02 ---
  command:
    special_factorial[3]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 07:33:02 ---
12

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:33:07 ---
Perfect! Let me verify: 3! * 2! * 1! = 6 * 2 * 1 = 12 âœ“

Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 21. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:33:09 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_139_q_session_32a14dd8/problem_solution_139.q
  content:
    special_factorial: {prd {prd 1+til x} each 1+til x}
    

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:33:14 ---
Done! The solution implements the special (Brazilian) factorial using idiomatic q:

- `{prd 1+til x}` computes the factorial of x (inline helper)
- `1+til x` generates the range [1, 2, ..., n]
- `each` applies the factorial function to each number in the range
- `prd` multiplies all the factorials together

The solution is vectorized and concise, leveraging q's functional programming strengths.
