Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/8
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List, Tuple


def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: sum_product

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_8.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll help you solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+. Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 22:47:15 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:47:18 ---
Now let me develop and test the `sum_product` function:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:47:19 ---
  command:
    sum_product: {[numbers] (sum numbers; prd numbers)};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:47:19 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:47:21 ---
Let me test with the examples from the problem:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:47:22 ---
  command:
    sum_product[`long$()]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 22:47:22 ---
List_Int64([0, 1])

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:47:25 ---
  command:
    sum_product[1 2 3 4]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 22:47:25 ---
List_Int64([10, 24])

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:47:27 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly. Let me verify a few more edge cases:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:47:28 ---
  command:
    sum_product[5]

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 22:47:28 ---
List_Int64([5, 5])

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:47:30 ---
  command:
    sum_product[1 1 1 1]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 22:47:30 ---
List_Int64([4, 1])

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:47:33 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 18. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:47:35 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_8_q_session_85657b6a/problem_solution_8.q
  content:
    sum_product: {[numbers] (sum numbers; prd numbers)}
    

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:47:39 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_8.q`.

The implementation uses:
- `sum` - q's built-in function that returns 0 for empty lists
- `prd` - q's built-in product function that returns 1 for empty lists
- Returns a tuple (2-element list) with sum and product as required
