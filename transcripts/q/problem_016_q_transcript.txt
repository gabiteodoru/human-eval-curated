Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/16
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: count_distinct_characters

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_16.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 22:53:14 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

Now let me develop the solution. The function needs to:
1. Convert the string to lowercase (to ignore case)
2. Find distinct characters
3. Count them

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:53:19 ---
  command:
    / First, let's test basic string operations
    s: "xyzXYZ";
    s

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:53:19 ---
String("xyzXYZ")

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:53:22 ---
  command:
    / Convert to lowercase using lower
    lower s

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 22:53:22 ---
String("xyzxyz")

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:53:25 ---
  command:
    / Get distinct characters
    distinct lower s

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 22:53:25 ---
String("xyz")

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:53:28 ---
  command:
    / Count them
    count distinct lower s

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 22:53:28 ---
3

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:53:31 ---
Perfect! Now let me create the function and test it with both examples:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:53:31 ---
  command:
    count_distinct_characters: {[string] count distinct lower string};

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 22:53:32 ---
None

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:53:34 ---
  command:
    / Test with first example
    count_distinct_characters["xyzXYZ"]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 22:53:34 ---
Error: match
Trace:
  [4]  count_distinct_characters:{[string] count distinct lower string}
                                 ^
  [3]  / Test with first example
count_distinct_characters["xyzXYZ"]
^


--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:53:35 ---
I need to use a different parameter name since `string` is a reserved word in q:

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:53:35 ---
  command:
    count_distinct_characters: {[s] count distinct lower s};

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 22:53:35 ---
None

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:53:38 ---
  command:
    / Test with first example
    count_distinct_characters["xyzXYZ"]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 22:53:38 ---
3

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:53:41 ---
  command:
    / Test with second example
    count_distinct_characters["Jerry"]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 22:53:41 ---
4

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:53:44 ---
Perfect! Both test cases pass. Let me verify the logic once more:

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:53:44 ---
  command:
    / Verify Jerry breakdown
    s: "Jerry";
    lower s

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 22:53:44 ---
String("jerry")

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:53:47 ---
  command:
    distinct lower "Jerry"

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 22:53:47 ---
String("jery")

--- 30. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:53:51 ---
Excellent! The distinct characters are 'j', 'e', 'r', 'y' (4 characters). Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 31. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:53:53 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_16_q_session_fed308d8/problem_solution_16.q
  content:
    count_distinct_characters: {[s] count distinct lower s}
    

--- 32. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:53:57 ---
Done! The solution is a clean, idiomatic q implementation that:
- Uses `lower` to convert the string to lowercase (case-insensitive comparison)
- Uses `distinct` to get unique characters
- Uses `count` to get the total number of distinct characters

The function passes both test cases:
- `count_distinct_characters["xyzXYZ"]` → 3
- `count_distinct_characters["Jerry"]` → 4
