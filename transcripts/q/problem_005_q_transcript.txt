Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/5
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List


def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'
    >>> intersperse([], 4)
    []
    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: intersperse

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_5.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Now let me develop and test the `intersperse` function in q:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:11 ---
  command:
    intersperse: {[numbers; delimeter] $[0=count numbers; numbers; raze (count[numbers]-1)#'enlist[;delimeter],/:numbers]}

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:45:11 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:45:14 ---
Let me test with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:14 ---
  command:
    intersperse[(); 4]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 22:45:14 ---
List_Untyped([])

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:14 ---
  command:
    intersperse[1 2 3; 4]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 22:45:14 ---
List_Untyped([QProjection(QFunction#101, QFunction#101, 4), 1, QProjection(QFunction#101, QFunction#101, 4), 2, QProjection(QFunction#101, QFunction#101, 4), 3])

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:45:17 ---
I see there's an issue with my approach. Let me reconsider the solution:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:18 ---
  command:
    intersperse: {[numbers; delimeter] $[0=count numbers; numbers; raze 1_'(enlist delimeter),/:numbers]}

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 22:45:18 ---
None

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:21 ---
  command:
    intersperse[1 2 3; 4]

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 22:45:21 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, 3])

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:45:24 ---
That's not right either. Let me think about this differently - I need to intersperse the delimiter between elements:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:26 ---
  command:
    intersperse: {[numbers; delimeter] $[1>=count numbers; numbers; raze (enlist each numbers[til count[numbers]-1],\:delimeter),enlist numbers[count[numbers]-1]]}

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 22:45:26 ---
None

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:29 ---
  command:
    intersperse[1 2 3; 4]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 22:45:29 ---
List_Untyped([List_Int64([1, 4]), List_Int64([2, 4]), 3])

--- 22. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:45:32 ---
I need to raze this properly. Let me try a cleaner approach:

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:33 ---
  command:
    intersperse: {[numbers; delimeter] $[1>=count numbers; numbers; raze numbers,\:delimeter except -1#delimeter]}

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 22:45:33 ---
None

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:35 ---
  command:
    intersperse[1 2 3; 4]

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 22:45:35 ---

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:45:37 ---
Let me use a simpler, more idiomatic approach:

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:38 ---
  command:
    intersperse: {[numbers; delimeter] $[1>=count numbers; numbers; raze (numbers,\:delimeter)[til (2*count numbers)-1]]}

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 22:45:38 ---
None

--- 30. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:42 ---
  command:
    intersperse[1 2 3; 4]

--- 31. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #30) at 22:45:42 ---
List_Int64([1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4])

--- 32. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:45:45 ---
Close! I have an extra delimiter at the end. Let me fix this:

--- 33. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:42 ---
  command:
    intersperse: {[numbers; delimeter] $[1>=count numbers; numbers; -1_raze numbers,\:delimeter]}

--- 34. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #33) at 22:45:42 ---
None

--- 35. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:45 ---
  command:
    intersperse[1 2 3; 4]

--- 36. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #35) at 22:45:45 ---
List_Int64([1, 4, 2, 4, 3])

--- 37. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:45:47 ---
Perfect! Now let me test the edge cases:

--- 38. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:48 ---
  command:
    intersperse[(); 4]

--- 39. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #38) at 22:45:48 ---
List_Untyped([])

--- 40. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:45:53 ---
  command:
    intersperse[enlist 5; 4]

--- 41. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #40) at 22:45:54 ---
List_Int64([5])

--- 42. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:45:57 ---
Excellent! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 43. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:46:00 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_5_q_session_b84180f4/problem_solution_5.q
  content:
    intersperse: {[numbers; delimeter] $[1>=count numbers; numbers; -1_raze numbers,\:delimeter]}
    

--- 44. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:46:04 ---
Solution complete! The function works by:
1. Handling edge cases: empty list or single element returns as-is
2. Using `,\:` to append the delimiter to each number
3. Using `raze` to flatten the result
4. Using `-1_` to drop the trailing delimiter
