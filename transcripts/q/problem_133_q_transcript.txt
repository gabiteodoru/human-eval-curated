Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/133
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def sum_squares(lst):
    """You are given a list of numbers.
    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14
    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98
    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84
    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29
    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6
    

    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: sum_squares

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_133.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:24:24 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:24:27 ---
Good! Now let me understand the problem:
- Take a list of numbers
- Round each element UP to the nearest integer (ceiling)
- Square each rounded value
- Return the sum

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:24:28 ---
  command:
    sum_squares: {sum {x*x} ceiling x};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:24:28 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:24:30 ---
Now let me test with the provided examples:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:24:30 ---
  command:
    sum_squares[1 2 3]

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 07:24:30 ---
14

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:24:32 ---
  command:
    sum_squares[1 4 9]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 07:24:32 ---
98

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:24:35 ---
  command:
    sum_squares[1 3 5 7]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 07:24:35 ---
84

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:24:38 ---
  command:
    sum_squares[1.4 4.2 0]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 07:24:38 ---
29

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:24:41 ---
  command:
    sum_squares[-2.4 1 1]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 07:24:41 ---
6

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:24:43 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me verify the logic once more and then write the solution to a file:

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:24:44 ---
  command:
    ceiling -2.4 1 1

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 07:24:44 ---
List_Int64([-2, 1, 1])

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:24:47 ---
  command:
    {x*x} -2 1 1

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 07:24:47 ---
List_Int64([4, 1, 1])

--- 23. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:24:51 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_133_q_session_8def328b/problem_solution_133.q
  content:
    sum_squares: {sum {x*x} ceiling x}
    

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:24:55 ---
Solution complete! The function:
- Uses `ceiling` to round each number up
- Applies `{x*x}` to square each value (vectorized)
- Uses `sum` to get the total

All test cases pass.
