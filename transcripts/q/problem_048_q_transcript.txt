Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/48
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def is_palindrome(text: str):
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome
    >>> is_palindrome('')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('aba')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')
    False
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: is_palindrome

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_48.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:27:14 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:27:17 ---
Now let me develop the `is_palindrome` function in q. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, so I need to check if a string equals its reverse.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:27:18 ---
  command:
    is_palindrome: {[text] text ~ reverse text};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:27:18 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:27:20 ---
Now let me test the function with the provided test cases:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:27:21 ---
  command:
    is_palindrome[""];

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:27:21 ---
None

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:27:23 ---
  command:
    is_palindrome["aba"];

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:27:23 ---
None

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:27:25 ---
Let me check the actual output:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:27:26 ---
  command:
    show is_palindrome[""];

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 23:27:26 ---
None

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:27:26 ---
  command:
    show is_palindrome["aba"];

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 23:27:26 ---
None

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:27:30 ---
Let me test with a simple query to see the output:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:27:30 ---
  command:
    is_palindrome[""]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 23:27:30 ---
True

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:27:33 ---
  command:
    is_palindrome["aba"]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 23:27:33 ---
True

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:27:35 ---
  command:
    is_palindrome["aaaaa"]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 23:27:35 ---
True

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:27:38 ---
  command:
    is_palindrome["zbcd"]

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 23:27:38 ---
False

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:27:41 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 27. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:27:43 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_48_q_session_0726656d/problem_solution_48.q
  content:
    is_palindrome: {[text] text ~ reverse text}
    

--- 28. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:27:48 ---
Done! The solution uses q's idiomatic approach:
- `reverse text` reverses the string
- `~` (match) checks for equality
- Returns a boolean (`1b` for true, `0b` for false)

All test cases pass correctly.
