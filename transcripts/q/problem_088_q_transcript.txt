Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/88
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def sort_array(array):
    """
    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,
    you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,
    or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.

    Note:
    * don't change the given array.

    Examples:
    * sort_array([]) => []
    * sort_array([5]) => [5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]) => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    """

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: sort_array

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_88.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 00:05:49 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:05:53 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. The logic is:
1. If array is empty or has 1 element, return as-is
2. Check if sum of first and last element is odd or even
3. Sort ascending if odd, descending if even

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:05:55 ---
  command:
    / Test empty array
    sort_array:{[arr] $[0=count arr; arr; 1=count arr; arr; (sum (first arr; last arr)) mod 2; asc arr; desc arr]};
    sort_array[]

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 00:05:55 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:05:58 ---
  command:
    / Test single element
    sort_array enlist 5

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 00:05:58 ---
List_Int64([5])

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:06:02 ---
  command:
    / Test array [2,4,3,0,1,5] - sum of first(2) and last(5) = 7 (odd) -> ascending
    sort_array 2 4 3 0 1 5

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 00:06:02 ---
List_Int64([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:06:05 ---
  command:
    / Test array [2,4,3,0,1,5,6] - sum of first(2) and last(6) = 8 (even) -> descending
    sort_array 2 4 3 0 1 5 6

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 00:06:05 ---
List_Int64([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0])

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:06:09 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me write the solution to the file:

--- 14. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 00:06:08 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_88_q_session_de381355/problem_solution_88.q
  content:
    sort_array:{[arr] $[0=count arr; arr; 1=count arr; arr; (sum (first arr; last arr)) mod 2; asc arr; desc arr]}
    

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:06:12 ---
Solution complete! The function:
- Returns empty array as-is
- Returns single element array as-is  
- For multi-element arrays: sums first and last elements, sorts ascending if sum is odd, descending if even
