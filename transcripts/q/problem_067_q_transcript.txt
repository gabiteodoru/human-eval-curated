Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

Problem HumanEval/67
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    """
    In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains 
    apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of 
    the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits 
    in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
    for examble:
    fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) ->19 - 5 - 6 = 8
    fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges",3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2
    fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95
    fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges",120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: fruit_distribution

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_67.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:44:07 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:44:07 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- Extract numbers from a string describing apples and oranges
- Subtract those numbers from the total fruit count to get mango count

Let me develop the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:44:09 ---
  command:
    / Test extracting numbers from string
    s: "5 apples and 6 oranges";
    / Use vs to split string and find numeric values
    s vs " "

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:44:09 ---
Error: type
Error info: Type mismatch -- function expected different input type or multiple parameters of a function need to match one another

  [3]

  ^


--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:44:12 ---
  command:
    / Use proper string split
    s: "5 apples and 6 oranges";
    " " vs s

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:44:12 ---

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:44:17 ---
  command:
    / Extract numbers from the split string
    s: "5 apples and 6 oranges";
    words: " " vs s;
    / Try to convert each word to a number, nulls for non-numbers
    "J"$words

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 23:44:17 ---

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:44:20 ---
  command:
    / Extract valid numbers and sum them
    s: "5 apples and 6 oranges";
    words: " " vs s;
    nums: "J"$words;
    / Filter out nulls and sum
    sum nums where not null nums

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 23:44:20 ---
11

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:44:23 ---
Perfect! Now let me create the complete function and test it with the examples:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:44:24 ---
  command:
    / Define the fruit_distribution function
    fruit_distribution: {[s;n]
      words: " " vs s;
      nums: "J"$words;
      n - sum nums where not null nums
      };

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:44:25 ---
None

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:44:28 ---
  command:
    / Test with the examples from the problem
    fruit_distribution["5 apples and 6 oranges"; 19]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 23:44:28 ---
8

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:44:31 ---
  command:
    fruit_distribution["0 apples and 1 oranges"; 3]

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 23:44:31 ---
2

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:44:34 ---
  command:
    fruit_distribution["2 apples and 3 oranges"; 100]

--- 21. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #20) at 23:44:34 ---
95

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:44:36 ---
  command:
    fruit_distribution["100 apples and 1 oranges"; 120]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 23:44:36 ---
19

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:44:36 ---
Excellent! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 25. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:44:38 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_67_q_session_9603a7b4/problem_solution_67.q
  content:
    fruit_distribution: {[s;n]
      words: " " vs s;
      nums: "J"$words;
      n - sum nums where not null nums
      };
    

--- 26. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:44:44 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_67.q`.

The function works by:
1. Splitting the string into words using `" " vs s`
2. Converting each word to a number using `"J"$words` (non-numeric words become null)
3. Filtering out nulls with `where not null nums` and summing the valid numbers
4. Subtracting the sum from the total fruit count `n` to get the mango count
