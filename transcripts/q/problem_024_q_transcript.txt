Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/24
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
    >>> largest_divisor(15)
    5
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: largest_divisor

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_24.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

Now let me understand the problem and develop a solution:

The task is to find the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n itself. The most efficient approach is to check divisors starting from n/2 and going down, or we can iterate from 2 upwards and find all divisors.

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:02:02 ---
  command:
    / Approach: Find all divisors from 2 to n-1, return the maximum
    / For efficiency, we only need to check up to n div 2
    largest_divisor: {[n] max 2_ where 0=n mod til n};

Good! Let me test with more cases:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:02:08 ---
  command:
    largest_divisor[12]

MINVAL_int64

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:02:16 ---
Interesting - for prime numbers like 7, there are no divisors except 1, and taking max of an empty list gives MINVAL. Let me handle this edge case:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:02:18 ---
  command:
    / Handle case where no divisors found (prime numbers) - should return 1
    largest_divisor: {[n] divisors: 2_ where 0=n mod til n; $[count divisors; max divisors; 1]};

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 23:02:18 ---

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:02:21 ---
  command:
    largest_divisor[7]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 23:02:21 ---

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:02:24 ---
  command:
    largest_divisor[15]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 23:02:24 ---

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:02:27 ---
  command:
    largest_divisor each 15 12 100 7 13 20

List_Int64([5, 6, 50, 1, 1, 10])

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:02:28 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 26. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:02:30 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_24_q_session_3cd66762/problem_solution_24.q
  content:
    largest_divisor: {[n] divisors: 2_ where 0=n mod til n; $[count divisors; max divisors; 1]};
    

--- 27. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:02:36 ---
Done! The solution has been written to `problem_solution_24.q`.

**Solution explanation:**
- `til n` generates numbers from 0 to n-1
- `0=n mod til n` finds which numbers divide n evenly
- `where` gets the indices (the actual divisors)
- `2_` drops the first 2 elements (0 and 1) to get divisors from 2 onwards
- `max divisors` returns the largest divisor
- The conditional `$[count divisors; max divisors; 1]` handles prime numbers (returning 1 when no divisors > 1 exist)

The solution leverages q's vectorized operations for efficiency and idiomatic q code.
