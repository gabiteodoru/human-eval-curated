Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/145
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def order_by_points(nums):
    """
    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers
    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,
    order them based on their index in original list.
    For negative numbers, the first digit is negative and remaining digits are positive when calculating the sum.

    For example:
    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
    >>> order_by_points([]) == []
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: order_by_points

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_145.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:35:58 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:36:02 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. The key points are:
1. Sort integers by sum of their digits
2. For negative numbers, only the first digit is negative
3. Preserve original order for items with the same digit sum (stable sort)

Let me start by creating a helper function to calculate the digit sum:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:04 ---
  command:
    / Helper to calculate sum of digits
    digitSum: {[n]
      $[n=0; 0;
        n<0; neg[first ds] + sum 1_ ds: 10 vs abs n;
        sum 10 vs n]
      };

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:36:04 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:07 ---
  command:
    / Test the digit sum function
    digitSum each 1 11 -1 -11 -12

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 07:36:07 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, -1, 0, 1])

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:36:11 ---
Good! Let me verify the logic:
- 1 → sum = 1 ✓
- 11 → sum = 1+1 = 2 ✓
- -1 → sum = -1 ✓
- -11 → sum = -1+1 = 0 ✓
- -12 → sum = -1+2 = 1 ✓

Now let me implement the main sorting function with stable sort:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:14 ---
  command:
    order_by_points: {[nums]
      if[0=count nums; :nums];
      / Calculate digit sums
      sums: digitSum each nums;
      / Create tuples of (digit_sum, original_index) for stable sort
      indices: til count nums;
      / Sort by (sum, index) and extract the sorted values
      nums iasc (sums;indices)
      };

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 07:36:14 ---
Error: assign

  / Calculate digit sums

      ^
  / Create tuples of (digit_sum, original_index) for stable sort


--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:36:16 ---
Let me fix the syntax - I need to use semicolons properly:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:17 ---
  command:
    order_by_points: {[nums]
      if[0=count nums; :nums];
      sums: digitSum each nums;
      indices: til count nums;
      nums iasc (sums;indices)
      };

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 07:36:17 ---
Error: assign
Trace:
  [3]  
  if[0=count nums; :nums];
  sums: digitSum each nums;
      ^
  indices: til count nums;


--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:36:20 ---
The issue is with multi-line function definitions. Let me write it in a single line:

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:21 ---
  command:
    order_by_points: {[nums] $[0=count nums; nums; nums iasc (digitSum each nums; til count nums)]};

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 07:36:21 ---
None

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:36:24 ---
Now let me test it with the examples:

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:25 ---
  command:
    order_by_points[1 11 -1 -11 -12]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 07:36:25 ---
List_Int64([11, 1])

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:36:27 ---
That's not right. Let me debug by checking what `iasc` returns:

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:28 ---
  command:
    nums: 1 11 -1 -11 -12;
    sums: digitSum each nums;
    sums

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 07:36:28 ---
Error: assign

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:30 ---
  command:
    nums: 1 11 -1 -11 -12; sums: digitSum each nums; sums

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 07:36:30 ---
Error: assign

                                  ^


--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:33 ---
  command:
    digitSum each 1 11 -1 -11 -12

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 07:36:33 ---
List_Int64([1, 2, -1, 0, 1])

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:36 ---
  command:
    iasc (digitSum each 1 11 -1 -11 -12; til 5)

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 07:36:36 ---
List_Int64([1, 0])

--- 30. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:36:40 ---
I see the issue - `iasc` on a list of lists doesn't work as expected. Let me try a different approach using `grade`:

--- 31. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:40 ---
  command:
    (digitSum each 1 11 -1 -11 -12; til 5)

--- 32. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #31) at 07:36:40 ---
List_Untyped([List_Int64([1, 2, -1, 0, 1]), List_Int64([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])])

--- 33. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:43 ---
  command:
    flip (digitSum each 1 11 -1 -11 -12; til 5)

--- 34. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #33) at 07:36:43 ---
List_Untyped([List_Int64([1, 0]), List_Int64([2, 1]), List_Int64([-1, 2]), List_Int64([0, 3]), List_Int64([1, 4])])

--- 35. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:36:46 ---
Good! Now let me sort using `asc`:

--- 36. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:46 ---
  command:
    asc flip (digitSum each 1 11 -1 -11 -12; til 5)

--- 37. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #36) at 07:36:46 ---
List_Untyped([List_Int64([-1, 2]), List_Int64([0, 3]), List_Int64([1, 0]), List_Int64([1, 4]), List_Int64([2, 1])])

--- 38. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:36:49 ---
Perfect! Now I need to extract the indices and use them to reorder the original array:

--- 39. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:49 ---
  command:
    last each asc flip (digitSum each 1 11 -1 -11 -12; til 5)

--- 40. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #39) at 07:36:49 ---
List_Int64([2, 3, 0, 4, 1])

--- 41. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:52 ---
  command:
    (1 11 -1 -11 -12)[last each asc flip (digitSum each 1 11 -1 -11 -12; til 5)]

--- 42. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #41) at 07:36:53 ---
List_Int64([-1, -11, 1, -12, 11])

--- 43. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:36:56 ---
Excellent! That matches the expected output `[-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]`. Now let me rewrite the function:

--- 44. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:36:57 ---
  command:
    order_by_points: {[nums] $[0=count nums; nums; nums[last each asc flip (digitSum each nums; til count nums)]]};

--- 45. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #44) at 07:36:57 ---
None

--- 46. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:37:00 ---
Let me test all the examples:

--- 47. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:37:01 ---
  command:
    order_by_points[1 11 -1 -11 -12]

--- 48. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #47) at 07:37:01 ---
List_Int64([-1, -11, 1, -12, 11])

--- 49. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:37:03 ---
  command:
    order_by_points[`long$()]

--- 50. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #49) at 07:37:03 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 51. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:37:06 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more edge cases:

--- 52. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:37:06 ---
  command:
    order_by_points[0 0 0]

--- 53. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #52) at 07:37:06 ---
List_Int64([0, 0, 0])

--- 54. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:37:09 ---
  command:
    order_by_points[123 -456 789 -123]

--- 55. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #54) at 07:37:09 ---
List_Int64([-123, 123, -456, 789])

--- 56. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:37:13 ---
Let me verify that last result:
- 123 → 1+2+3 = 6
- -456 → -4+5+6 = 7
- 789 → 7+8+9 = 24
- -123 → -1+2+3 = 4

So sorted by digit sum: -123(4), 123(6), -456(7), 789(24) ✓

Now let me write the solution to a file:

--- 57. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:37:19 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_145_q_session_159651c8/problem_solution_145.q
  content:
    / Helper function to calculate sum of digits
    / For negative numbers, only the first digit is negative
    digitSum: {[n]
      $[n=0; 0;
        n<0; neg[first ds] + sum 1_ ds: 10 vs abs n;
        sum 10 vs n]
      };
    
    / Main function to sort integers by sum of their digits
    / Preserves original order for items with same digit sum (stable sort)
    order_by_points: {[nums]
      $[0=count nums;
        nums;
        nums[last each asc flip (digitSum each nums; til count nums)]]
      };
    

--- 58. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:37:24 ---
Perfect! The solution is complete. Here's what I implemented:

**Solution Overview:**
- `digitSum`: Helper function that calculates the sum of digits, treating negative numbers specially (first digit negative, rest positive)
- `order_by_points`: Sorts by creating (digit_sum, index) pairs, sorting them, and reordering the original array accordingly

**Key q idioms used:**
- `10 vs n` - converts number to list of digits
- `asc flip` - sorts tuples lexicographically 
- `last each` - extracts indices from sorted tuples
- Vectorized operations with `each` for efficiency
