Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

Problem HumanEval/94

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def skjkasdkd(lst):
    """You are given a list of integers.

    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25
    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: skjkasdkd

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_94.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this step by step.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop a solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:48:21 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:48:24 ---
Now let me break down the problem:
1. Find the largest prime number in a list
2. Return the sum of its digits

Let me start by creating a helper function to check if a number is prime, then find the largest prime, and sum its digits.

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:48:27 ---
  command:
    / Check if a number is prime
    isPrime: {[n]
      if[n<2; :0b];
      if[n=2; :1b];
      if[0=n mod 2; :0b];
      limit: floor sqrt n;
      divisors: 2_til 1+limit;
      all 0<>n mod divisors
    };

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:48:27 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:48:33 ---
  command:
    / Test isPrime
    isPrime each 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 07:48:33 ---
List_Bool([True, True, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True])

--- 9. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:48:35 ---
Good! Now let me create a function to sum the digits of a number:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:48:36 ---
  command:
    / Sum digits of a number
    sumDigits: {[n]
      sum "j"$string[n] except "."
    };

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 07:48:36 ---
None

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:48:40 ---
  command:
    / Test sumDigits
    sumDigits each 181 4597 5107

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 07:48:40 ---
List_Int64([154, 217, 205])

--- 14. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:48:43 ---
Hmm, that's not working correctly. Let me fix the digit summing:

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:48:44 ---
  command:
    / Better approach - convert to string and parse each digit
    sumDigits: {[n]
      sum -48+"i"$string n
    };

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 07:48:44 ---
None

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:48:46 ---
  command:
    / Test sumDigits
    sumDigits each 181 4597 5107

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 07:48:46 ---
List_Int64([10, 25, 13])

--- 19. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:48:49 ---
Perfect! Now let me create the main function:

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:48:50 ---
  command:
    / Main function
    skjkasdkd: {[lst]
      primes: lst where isPrime each lst;
      if[0=count primes; :0];
      sumDigits max primes
    };

--- 34. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:49:13 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to a file:

--- 35. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:49:19 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_94_q_session_1827a7c6/problem_solution_94.q
  content:
    / Check if a number is prime
    isPrime: {[n]
      if[n<2; :0b];
      if[n=2; :1b];
      if[0=n mod 2; :0b];
      limit: floor sqrt n;
      divisors: 2_til 1+limit;
      all 0<>n mod divisors
    };
    
    / Sum digits of a number
    sumDigits: {[n]
      sum -48+"i"$string n
    };
    
    / Main function: find largest prime and return sum of its digits
    skjkasdkd: {[lst]
      primes: lst where isPrime each lst;
      if[0=count primes; :0];
      sumDigits max primes
    };
    

--- 36. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:49:24 ---
Solution complete! The implementation:

1. **`isPrime`** - Checks if a number is prime using trial division up to âˆšn
2. **`sumDigits`** - Converts number to string, then sums ASCII values offset by 48 (ASCII '0')
3. **`skjkasdkd`** - Filters the list for primes, finds the maximum, and returns the sum of its digits

All test cases pass successfully.
