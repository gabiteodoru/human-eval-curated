Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/57
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def monotonic(l: list):
    """Return True is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
    >>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
    True
    >>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
    False
    >>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
    True
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: monotonic

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_57.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

First, let me connect to the q server and develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:35:13 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:35:16 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- The function should return `1b` (True) if the list is monotonically increasing OR decreasing
- Monotonically increasing: each element >= previous element
- Monotonically decreasing: each element <= previous element

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:35:18 ---
  command:
    monotonic: {[l] (all 0 <= deltas l) or all 0 >= deltas l}

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:35:18 ---
None

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:35:17 ---
  command:
    monotonic[1 2 4 20]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 23:35:17 ---
True

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:35:20 ---
  command:
    monotonic[1 20 4 10]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 23:35:20 ---
False

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:35:23 ---
  command:
    monotonic[4 1 0 -10]

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 23:35:23 ---
False

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:35:26 ---
Hmm, the last test case failed. Let me check what `deltas` returns:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:35:26 ---
  command:
    deltas 4 1 0 -10

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 23:35:26 ---
List_Int64([4, -3, -1, -10])

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:35:30 ---
I see the issue. `deltas` returns the first element as-is, then the differences. For monotonically decreasing, I need to check if all deltas (except the first) are <= 0. Let me refine:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:35:31 ---
  command:
    monotonic: {[l] d:1 _ deltas l; (all 0 <= d) or all 0 >= d}

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 23:35:31 ---
None

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:35:33 ---
  command:
    monotonic[1 2 4 20]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 23:35:33 ---
True

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:35:36 ---
  command:
    monotonic[1 20 4 10]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 23:35:36 ---
False

--- 23. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:35:39 ---
  command:
    monotonic[4 1 0 -10]

--- 24. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #23) at 23:35:39 ---
True

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:35:42 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Let me test a few edge cases:

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:35:42 ---
  command:
    monotonic[enlist 5]

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 23:35:43 ---
True

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:35:45 ---
  command:
    monotonic[5 5 5 5]

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 23:35:45 ---
True

--- 30. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:35:48 ---
  command:
    monotonic[`long$()]

--- 31. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #30) at 23:35:48 ---
True

--- 32. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:35:49 ---
Great! The solution handles edge cases well. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 33. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:35:52 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_57_q_session_028fa96b/problem_solution_57.q
  content:
    monotonic: {[l] d:1 _ deltas l; (all 0 <= d) or all 0 >= d}
    

--- 34. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:36:00 ---
Solution complete! The `monotonic` function:
- Uses `deltas` to compute differences between consecutive elements
- Drops the first element (which is the original first value) using `1 _`
- Checks if all differences are non-negative (increasing) OR non-positive (decreasing)
- Returns `1b` (True) if either condition holds
