Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/104
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def unique_digits(x):
    """Given a list of positive integers x. return a sorted list of all 
    elements that hasn't any even digit.

    Note: Returned list should be sorted in increasing order.
    
    For example:
    >>> unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])
    [1, 15, 33]
    >>> unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])
    []
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: unique_digits

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_104.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:59:47 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:59:51 ---
Now let me understand the problem:
- Given a list of positive integers
- Return a sorted list of elements that have NO even digits (0,2,4,6,8)
- Only odd digits (1,3,5,7,9) are allowed

Let me develop the solution interactively:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:59:52 ---
  command:
    / Helper function to check if a number has any even digit
    hasEvenDigit: {any 0=mod[;2] 10 vs x};
    hasEvenDigit 15

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:59:52 ---
False

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:59:56 ---
  command:
    hasEvenDigit 1422

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 07:59:56 ---
True

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:59:58 ---
  command:
    hasEvenDigit 33

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 07:59:58 ---
False

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:00:00 ---
Good! Now let me create the main function:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:00:01 ---
  command:
    unique_digits: {asc x where not hasEvenDigit each x};
    unique_digits[15 33 1422 1]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 08:00:01 ---
List_Int64([1, 15, 33])

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:00:04 ---
  command:
    unique_digits[152 323 1422 10]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 08:00:04 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:00:07 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few edge cases:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:00:07 ---
  command:
    unique_digits[1 3 5 7 9]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 08:00:07 ---
List_Int64([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:00:10 ---
  command:
    unique_digits[2 4 6 8 10]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 08:00:10 ---
List_Int64([])

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 08:00:13 ---
  command:
    unique_digits[135 975 531 100 200]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 08:00:14 ---
List_Int64([135, 531, 975])

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:00:16 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 24. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:00:20 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_104_q_session_a1b9f6e4/problem_solution_104.q
  content:
    / Helper function to check if a number has any even digit
    hasEvenDigit: {any 0=mod[;2] 10 vs x};
    
    / Given a list of positive integers x, return a sorted list of all
    / elements that don't have any even digit
    unique_digits: {asc x where not hasEvenDigit each x};
    

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:00:28 ---
Solution complete! The implementation:

1. **`hasEvenDigit`**: Checks if a number contains any even digit by:
   - `10 vs x` - converts the number to a list of digits
   - `mod[;2]` - checks modulo 2 for each digit
   - `0=` - identifies even digits (remainder 0)
   - `any` - returns true if any digit is even

2. **`unique_digits`**: Filters and sorts the input by:
   - `hasEvenDigit each x` - applies the check to each number
   - `not` - inverts to get numbers WITHOUT even digits
   - `where` - filters the list
   - `asc` - sorts in ascending order

The solution is vectorized and uses idiomatic q operations.
