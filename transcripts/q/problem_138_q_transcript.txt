Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/138
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
    Example
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: is_equal_to_sum_even

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_138.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using q/kdb+.

First, let me understand the problem:
- We need to check if a number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
- The minimum positive even number is 2
- So the minimum sum of 4 positive even numbers is 2+2+2+2 = 8

Let me connect to the q server and develop the solution:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 07:31:56 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:32:00 ---
Now let me analyze the problem mathematically:
- Any number that can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers must be:
  1. At least 8 (since 2+2+2+2 = 8)
  2. Even (since the sum of 4 even numbers is even)

Let me verify this logic with the examples:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:32:03 ---
  command:
    // Test the examples
    // is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False -> 4 < 8, so False
    // is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False -> 6 < 8, so False  
    // is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True -> 8 = 2+2+2+2, so True
    
    // The solution: n must be even AND >= 8
    is_equal_to_sum_even: {[n] (n>=8) and 0=n mod 2};
    
    // Test with examples
    is_equal_to_sum_even[4]

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 07:32:03 ---
False

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:32:06 ---
  command:
    is_equal_to_sum_even[6]

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 07:32:06 ---
False

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:32:08 ---
  command:
    is_equal_to_sum_even[8]

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 07:32:08 ---
True

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:32:11 ---
Perfect! Let me test a few more cases to ensure the logic is correct:

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:32:12 ---
  command:
    // Test more cases
    // 10 = 2+2+2+4, should be True
    is_equal_to_sum_even[10]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 07:32:12 ---
True

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:32:15 ---
  command:
    // Test odd number >= 8, should be False
    is_equal_to_sum_even[9]

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 07:32:15 ---
False

--- 16. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 07:32:18 ---
  command:
    // Test larger even number, should be True
    // 12 = 2+2+2+6, should be True
    is_equal_to_sum_even[12]

--- 17. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #16) at 07:32:18 ---
True

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:32:21 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to a file:

--- 19. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 07:32:22 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_138_q_session_052fa88a/problem_solution_138.q
  content:
    is_equal_to_sum_even: {[n] (n>=8) and 0=n mod 2}
    

--- 20. Text Block (Message #1) at 07:32:27 ---
Perfect! The solution is complete and written to `problem_solution_138.q`.

**Solution explanation:**
- A number can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers if and only if:
  1. It's at least 8 (minimum is 2+2+2+2 = 8)
  2. It's even (sum of even numbers is always even)
- The q implementation: `{[n] (n>=8) and 0=n mod 2}` checks both conditions concisely
