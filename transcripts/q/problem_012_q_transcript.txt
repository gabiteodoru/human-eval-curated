Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/12
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

from typing import List, Optional


def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """ Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple
    strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty.
    >>> longest([])

    >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'a'
    >>> longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc'])
    'ccc'
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: longest

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_12.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll help you solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+. Let me start by connecting to the q server and then developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 22:50:01 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:50:05 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. The function should:
1. Return null/empty for an empty list
2. Return the longest string
3. Return the first one if there are multiple strings of the same length

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:06 ---
  command:
    longest: {[strings] $[0=count strings; `; strings first idesc count each strings]};

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 22:50:06 ---
None

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:50:09 ---
Let me test this solution with the examples from the problem:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:10 ---
  command:
    longest[()];

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 22:50:10 ---
None

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:09 ---
  command:
    longest[("a";"b";"c")];

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 22:50:09 ---
None

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:50:12 ---
Let me check what the function returned:

--- 13. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:12 ---
  command:
    show longest[("a";"b";"c")];

--- 14. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #13) at 22:50:12 ---
None

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:15 ---
  command:
    longest[("a";"bb";"ccc")];

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 22:50:15 ---
None

--- 17. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:50:20 ---
Let me check the actual output with a different approach:

--- 18. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:21 ---
  command:
    r1: longest[()]; r2: longest[("a";"b";"c")]; r3: longest[("a";"bb";"ccc")]; (r1;r2;r3);

--- 19. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #18) at 22:50:21 ---
None

--- 20. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__get_last_query_result_q_view (Message #1) at 22:50:24 ---
  (no parameters)

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:50:27 ---
Let me try a simpler test:

--- 22. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:27 ---
  command:
    longest[("a";"bb";"ccc")]

--- 23. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #22) at 22:50:27 ---
String("ccc")

--- 24. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:50:30 ---
Good! Now let me test the other cases:

--- 25. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:31 ---
  command:
    longest[("a";"b";"c")]

--- 26. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #25) at 22:50:31 ---
Char('a')

--- 27. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:34 ---
  command:
    longest[()]

--- 28. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #27) at 22:50:34 ---
""

--- 29. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:50:38 ---
I see the issue - when the list is empty, it returns an empty symbol instead of a proper null. Also, when all strings are the same length, it's returning a char instead of a string. Let me refine the solution:

--- 30. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:37 ---
  command:
    longest: {[strings] $[0=count strings; ::; strings first idesc count each strings]};

--- 31. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #30) at 22:50:37 ---
None

--- 32. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:50:40 ---
Let me test the updated function:

--- 33. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:40 ---
  command:
    longest[()]

--- 34. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #33) at 22:50:40 ---
None

--- 35. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:43 ---
  command:
    longest[("a";"b";"c")]

--- 36. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #35) at 22:50:43 ---
Char('a')

--- 37. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:46 ---
  command:
    longest[("a";"bb";"ccc")]

--- 38. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #37) at 22:50:46 ---
String("ccc")

--- 39. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:50:50 ---
I see the issue - when single character strings are indexed, they return chars. Let me check the type of the input to understand better:

--- 40. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:51 ---
  command:
    type each ("a";"b";"c")

--- 41. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #40) at 22:50:51 ---
List_Int16([-10, -10, -10])

--- 42. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:50:55 ---
The strings are correctly stored as character lists (type -10). The issue is just presentation. Let me verify the solution works correctly by testing a few more cases:

--- 43. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:50:56 ---
  command:
    test1: longest[("a";"bb";"ccc")]; test2: longest[("abc";"de";"f")]; test3: longest[("hello";"world")]; test4: longest[enlist "solo"]; (test1;test2;test3;test4)

--- 44. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #43) at 22:50:56 ---
List_Untyped([String("ccc"), String("abc"), String("hello"), String("solo")])

--- 45. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:50:59 ---
Perfect! Let me also verify that when there are multiple strings of the same length, it returns the first one:

--- 46. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 22:51:00 ---
  command:
    longest[("aa";"bb";"cc")]

--- 47. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #46) at 22:51:00 ---
String("aa")

--- 48. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:51:03 ---
Excellent! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 49. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 22:51:05 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_12_q_session_1877cd7d/problem_solution_12.q
  content:
    longest: {[strings] $[0=count strings; ::; strings first idesc count each strings]};
    

--- 50. Text Block (Message #1) at 22:51:08 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_12.q`.

**Summary:**
- The function returns `::` (null) for empty lists
- Uses `count each` to get the length of each string (vectorized operation)
- Uses `idesc` to get indices sorted by descending length
- Takes the `first` index to get the longest (or first of equal length)
- Returns the corresponding string from the original list
