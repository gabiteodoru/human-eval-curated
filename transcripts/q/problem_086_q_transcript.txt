Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/86
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: anti_shuffle

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_86.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 00:03:40 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:03:43 ---
Now let me develop and test the solution. The problem requires:
1. Split string by spaces
2. For each word, sort characters by ASCII value
3. Rejoin words with spaces

Let me start by exploring q's string manipulation capabilities:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:03:43 ---
  command:
    / Test splitting by space
    " " vs "Hello World!!!"

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 00:03:44 ---
List_Untyped([String("Hello"), String("World!!!")])

--- 7. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:03:47 ---
  command:
    / Test sorting characters in a string
    asc "hello"

--- 8. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #7) at 00:03:47 ---
String("ehllo")

--- 9. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:03:49 ---
  command:
    / Test sorting with mixed case
    asc "Hello"

--- 10. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #9) at 00:03:49 ---
String("Hello")

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:03:52 ---
  command:
    / Test sorting "World!!!"
    asc "World!!!"

--- 12. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #11) at 00:03:52 ---
String("!!!Wdlor")

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:03:55 ---
Perfect! Now let me build the complete solution:

--- 14. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:03:57 ---
  command:
    / Define anti_shuffle function
    anti_shuffle: {[s] " " sv asc each " " vs s};

--- 15. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #14) at 00:03:57 ---
None

--- 16. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:04:00 ---
Now let me test it with the provided examples:

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:04:01 ---
  command:
    / Test case 1: 'Hi' should return 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle["Hi"]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 00:04:01 ---
String("Hi")

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:04:04 ---
  command:
    / Test case 2: 'hello' should return 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle["hello"]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 00:04:04 ---
String("ehllo")

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:04:07 ---
  command:
    / Test case 3: 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    anti_shuffle["Hello World!!!"]

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 00:04:07 ---
String("Hello !!!Wdlor")

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:04:10 ---
Excellent! All test cases pass. Let me test a few edge cases:

--- 24. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:04:10 ---
  command:
    / Test empty string
    anti_shuffle[""]

--- 25. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #24) at 00:04:10 ---
String("")

--- 26. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:04:13 ---
  command:
    / Test single word
    anti_shuffle["world"]

--- 27. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #26) at 00:04:13 ---
String("dlorw")

--- 28. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 00:04:13 ---
  command:
    / Test multiple spaces
    anti_shuffle["ab  cd"]

--- 29. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #28) at 00:04:13 ---
String("ab  cd")

--- 30. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:04:16 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 31. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 00:04:19 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_86_q_session_df037aaa/problem_solution_86.q
  content:
    anti_shuffle: {[s] " " sv asc each " " vs s};
    

--- 32. Text Block (Message #1) at 00:04:25 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_86.q`.

The implementation is concise and idiomatic q:
- `" " vs s` - splits the string by spaces into a list of words
- `asc each` - applies `asc` (ascending sort) to each word, sorting characters by ASCII value
- `" " sv` - joins the sorted words back together with spaces

This leverages q's vectorized operations and functional programming style for a clean, efficient solution.
