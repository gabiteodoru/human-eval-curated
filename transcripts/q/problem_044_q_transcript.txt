Please solve this HumanEval problem using native q/kdb+.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/44
============================================================

PYTHON REFERENCE (implement equivalent behavior in q/kdb+):

def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    """Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    return string representation after the conversion.
    base numbers are less than 10.
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'
    """

============================================================

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: change_base

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_44.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using native q/kdb+.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and developing the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:22:26 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

Now let's understand the problem: we need to convert a number from base 10 to another base (less than 10), returning a string representation.

Let me develop and test the solution:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:22:33 ---
  command:
    / First, let's understand the algorithm:
    / To convert a number to a different base, we repeatedly divide by the base
    / and collect the remainders, then reverse them
    
    / Test the logic manually for change_base(8, 3):
    / 8 div 3 = 2, remainder 2
    / 2 div 3 = 0, remainder 2
    / Result: "22"
    
    x:8; base:3;
    remainders: ();
    while[x > 0; remainders,: x mod base; x: x div base];
    reverse remainders

Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 47. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:23:35 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_44_q_session_16c1b3b7/problem_solution_44.q
  content:
    change_base:{[x;base]
      $[x=0; "0";
        [seq: {x div y}[;base] scan x;
         remainders: -1 _ seq mod base;
         raze reverse string remainders]]
      };
    

--- 48. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:23:44 ---
Solution complete! The `change_base` function:

1. **Handles the zero case**: Returns `"0"` when input is 0
2. **Uses functional scan**: Leverages q's scan operator to generate quotient sequence by repeatedly dividing by the base
3. **Extracts remainders**: Takes modulo of the sequence and drops the final 0
4. **Converts to string**: Reverses the remainders and joins them into a string

The algorithm uses idiomatic q with scan for iteration and proper vectorized operations.
