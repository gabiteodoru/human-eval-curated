Problem HumanEval/63

def fibfib(n: int):

Q/KDB+ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Implement using native q/kdb+ syntax and idioms
- PREFER VECTORIZED OPERATIONS over explicit loops (each, while)
- Use q's functional programming: map ('), reduce (/), scan (\)
- Leverage q's built-in functions: sum, min, max, avg, count, etc.
- Use q list operations: til, where, distinct, group, etc.
- For string operations, use q string functions and symbol handling
- Parameter names should avoid q reserved words
- The Python type hints provide context for q type expectations
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use q tools: mcp__qmcp__query_q for testing and development
- Write clean, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths
============================================================

Function name: fibfib

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use native q tools (mcp__qmcp__query_q) to develop and test your solution
3. Once you have a working solution, write it to a file named "problem_solution_63.q". The file should only contain the function definition and any helper functions it needs to run.

IMPORTANT: Use semicolons `;` between q statements. Both mcp__qmcp__query_q and the testing suite communicate with the q server via IPC, which requires a different format from loading q scripts and makes semicolons necessary.

E.g.

```q
f: {x+1}
f[1]
```
WRONG: missing semicolon, raises confusing error: `'f`

```q
f: {x+1};
f[1]
```
CORRECT!

Your solution should be complete, idiomatic q code that leverages the language's strengths.

I'll solve this HumanEel problem step by step. Let me start by connecting to the q server and then develop the solution.

--- 3. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q (Message #1) at 23:40:35 ---
  host:
    localhost:5001

--- 4. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:40:39 ---
Now let me understand the FibFib sequence and develop a solution. The sequence is:
- fibfib(0) = 0
- fibfib(1) = 0
- fibfib(2) = 1
- fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)

Let me test a few values first to verify my understanding:

--- 5. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:40:41 ---
  command:
    / Test the sequence manually
    / fibfib(0) = 0
    / fibfib(1) = 0
    / fibfib(2) = 1
    / fibfib(3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
    / fibfib(4) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2
    / fibfib(5) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
    / fibfib(6) = 2 + 1 + 4 = 7
    / fibfib(7) = 4 + 2 + 7 = 13
    / fibfib(8) = 7 + 4 + 13 = 24
    0 0 1 1 2 4 7 13 24

--- 6. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #5) at 23:40:41 ---
List_Int64([0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24])

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:40:42 ---
Good! Now let me develop an efficient solution using q's scan operator to build up the sequence:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:40:45 ---
  command:
    / Efficient iterative solution using scan
    fibfib: {[n]
      $[n<2; 0;
        n=2; 1;
        / Build sequence up to n using scan
        last {x,sum -3#x}[0 0 1]/[n-2;0 0 1]
      ]
     };

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #8) at 23:40:45 ---
None

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:40:48 ---
  command:
    / Test the example cases
    fibfib[1]

--- 11. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #10) at 23:40:48 ---
0

--- 12. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:40:51 ---
  command:
    fibfib[5]

--- 13. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #12) at 23:40:51 ---
0

--- 14. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:40:54 ---
Hmm, that's not right. Let me fix the logic:

--- 15. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:40:56 ---
  command:
    / Let me reconsider - using scan to iterate n-2 times
    fibfib: {[n]
      $[n<2; 0;
        n=2; 1;
        / Start with [0,0,1] and iterate n-2 times, each time appending sum of last 3
        last {x,sum -3#x}/[n-2;0 0 1]
      ]
     };

--- 16. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #15) at 23:40:56 ---
None

--- 17. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:40:59 ---
  command:
    fibfib[5]

--- 18. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #17) at 23:40:59 ---
4

--- 19. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:41:01 ---
  command:
    fibfib[8]

--- 20. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #19) at 23:41:01 ---
24

--- 21. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__query_q (Message #1) at 23:41:04 ---
  command:
    fibfib each 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

--- 22. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__query_q (Event #21) at 23:41:04 ---
List_Int64([0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24])

--- 23. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:41:07 ---
Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 24. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 23:41:10 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_63_q_session_82517e8c/problem_solution_63.q
  content:
    fibfib: {[n]
      $[n<2; 0;
        n=2; 1;
        last {x,sum -3#x}/[n-2;0 0 1]
      ]
     };
    

--- 25. Text Block (Message #1) at 23:41:11 ---
Done! The solution uses q's scan operator (`/[n]`) to efficiently build the FibFib sequence iteratively:

- For n < 2, return 0
- For n = 2, return 1  
- Otherwise, start with `[0,0,1]` and iterate n-2 times, each time appending the sum of the last 3 elements, then return the last value

This is an efficient O(n) solution that leverages q's functional programming strengths.
