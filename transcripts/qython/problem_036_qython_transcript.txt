QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: fizz_buzz

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_36.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and understand the problem better:

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:57:32 ---
Now let me analyze the problem:
- Find all integers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13
- Count how many times the digit 7 appears in those numbers
- Examples: fizz_buzz(50)=0, fizz_buzz(78)=2, fizz_buzz(79)=3

Let me implement and test this step by step:

Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_36.qy`. The solution:

1. Uses `np.arange(n)` to generate all numbers from 0 to n-1
2. Filters for numbers divisible by 11 or 13 using element-wise modulo and boolean operations
3. Counts occurrences of digit '7' in each filtered number using a helper function
4. Returns the total count

All test cases pass: `fizz_buzz(50)=0`, `fizz_buzz(78)=2`, `fizz_buzz(79)=3`.
