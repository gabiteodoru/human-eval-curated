Please solve this HumanEval problem using Qython.

============================================================
Problem HumanEval/68
============================================================

def pluck(arr):
    """
    "
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []
    
    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000
        * 0 <= node.value

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: pluck

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_68.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

Perfect! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Now let me write the Qython code to the output file:

  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_68_qython_session_e80b6308/problem_solution_68.qy
  content:
    def pluck(arr):
        # If array is empty, return empty list
        if len(arr) == 0:
            return []
    
        # Find even values
        evens_mask = arr % 2 == 0
        even_indices = where(evens_mask)
    
        # If no even values, return empty list
        if len(even_indices) == 0:
            return []
    
        # Get the even values
        evens = arr[even_indices]
    
        # Find the minimum even value
        min_even = np.min(evens)
    
        # Find the index of the first occurrence of min_even in original array
        min_idx = arr.index(min_even)
    
        return [min_even, min_idx]
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:38:26 ---
Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_68.qy`. 

The solution:
1. Returns empty list for empty arrays
2. Uses vectorized operations to find even numbers (` arr % 2 == 0`)
3. Uses `where()` to get indices of even values
4. Finds the minimum even value using `np.min()`
5. Uses `.index()` method to find the first occurrence of that minimum value in the original array
6. Returns `[smallest_even_value, its_index]`

All test cases pass correctly.
