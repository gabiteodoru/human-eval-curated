QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: running_max

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_9.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:41:29 ---
Now let me implement and test the `running_max` function. The problem asks for a running maximum, which is a cumulative maximum operation - perfect for `np.cummax()`:

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Let me test a few more edge cases to ensure robustness:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Message #1) at 08:41:39 ---
  qython_code:
    # Test edge cases
    print(String("Test 1 - Single element:"), running_max([5]))
    print(String("Test 2 - Decreasing:"), running_max([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]))
    print(String("Test 3 - Increasing:"), running_max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
    print(String("Test 4 - All same:"), running_max([3, 3, 3, 3]))
    print(String("Test 5 - Empty:"), running_max([]))

Excellent! All tests pass. Now let me write the final solution to the file:

--- 14. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:41:43 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_9_qython_session_4ab91f2f/problem_solution_9.qy
  content:
    def running_max(numbers):
        """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of running maximum element found until given moment
        in the sequence.
        >>> running_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
        [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
        """
        return np.cummax(numbers)
    

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:41:46 ---
Done! The solution uses `np.cummax()` which computes the cumulative maximum - exactly what's needed for the running maximum operation. The function has been tested with various cases and written to `problem_solution_9.qy`.
