QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: triples_sum_to_zero

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_40.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

Now let me setup the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:17:45 ---
Now let me implement and test the solution. The problem asks to find if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero. I'll use a vectorized approach with NumPy:

Perfect! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Now let me write the Qython code to the output file:

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:18:01 ---
Solution complete! The Qython implementation:

- Checks if there are at least 3 elements in the list
- Uses three nested while loops to iterate through all combinations of three distinct positions (i < j < k)
- Returns `True` immediately when finding a triple that sums to zero
- Returns `False` if no such triple exists

The solution passes all test cases and is saved to `problem_solution_40.qy`.
