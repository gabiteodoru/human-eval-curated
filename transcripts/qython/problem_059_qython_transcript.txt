QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: largest_prime_factor

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_59.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

Now let me think about the problem. I need to find the largest prime factor of n. The approach:

1. Start dividing n by 2 until it's no longer divisible
2. Then check odd numbers starting from 3
3. The last factor we find will be the largest prime factor

Let me implement and test this:

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write the Qython code to the file:

Done! The solution has been implemented and tested:

- ✅ Correctly returns 29 for input 13195
- ✅ Correctly returns 2 for input 2048

The algorithm efficiently finds the largest prime factor by:
1. Dividing out all factors of 2
2. Checking odd numbers from 3 onwards up to √n
3. The last factor found is guaranteed to be the largest prime factor
