QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: sort_even

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_37.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll help you solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by understanding the problem and then implement a solution.

The problem asks us to sort only the values at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) while keeping odd indices unchanged.

Let me connect to the q server and implement the solution step by step.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

Now let me understand the problem better and implement a solution. The problem wants us to:
1. Extract values at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...)
2. Sort those values
3. Put them back at even indices while keeping odd indices unchanged

Let me implement and test this:

Let me fix the issue - `.copy()` is not available in Qython. I'll use a different approach:

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Let me verify with the test cases:
- `[1, 2, 3]` → `[1, 2, 3]` ✓ (even indices 0,2 have values [1,3], sorted is [1,3], put back → [1,2,3])
- `[5, 6, 3, 4]` → `[3, 6, 5, 4]` ✓ (even indices 0,2 have values [5,3], sorted is [3,5], put back → [3,6,5,4])

Now let me write the final solution to a file:

Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_37.qy`. The function extracts values at even indices, sorts them, and places them back while keeping odd indices unchanged.
