Please solve this HumanEval problem using Qython.

Problem HumanEval/80
============================================================

def is_happy(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.
    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct
    For example:
    is_happy(String('a')) => False
    is_happy(String('aa')) => False
    is_happy(String('abcd')) => True
    is_happy(String('aabb')) => False
    is_happy(String('adb')) => True
    is_happy(String('xyy')) => False

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: is_happy

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_80.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me understand the problem:
- A string is happy if its length is at least 3 AND every 3 consecutive letters are distinct
- I need to check all 3-character windows to ensure no character repeats within each window

Let me implement and test this:

Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to a file without the test code:

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:45:33 ---
Done! I've successfully:

1. Connected to the q server on localhost:5001
2. Implemented the `is_happy` function in Qython that checks if a string is happy (length >= 3 and every 3 consecutive characters are distinct)
3. Tested it against all provided test cases - all pass
4. Written the solution to `problem_solution_80.qy`

The solution uses a while loop to iterate through each 3-character window and checks if all 3 characters are unique using `np.unique()`.
