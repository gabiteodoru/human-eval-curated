def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    """
    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
    and all buckets have the same capacity.
    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.

    Example 1:

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: max_fill

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_115.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

Now let me understand the problem and implement a solution:

The problem asks to calculate how many times we need to lower buckets to empty all wells. Each well is a row, and we need to count 1s in each row, then divide by bucket capacity (rounding up).

Let me set up the Qython namespace and develop the solution:

I see the issue - `np.sum` with `axis` parameter isn't supported in Qython. Let me use a different approach with `map`:

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 12:56:23 ---
Done! I've successfully implemented the `max_fill` function in Qython and saved it to `problem_solution_115.qy`.

The solution:
1. Maps over each well (row) in the grid
2. For each well, sums the water units (1s) 
3. Calculates bucket lowers needed using ceiling division: `(water_units + capacity - 1) // capacity`
4. Sums all bucket lowers across all wells

All three test cases pass correctly.
