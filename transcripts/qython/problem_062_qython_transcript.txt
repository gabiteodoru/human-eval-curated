QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: derivative

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_62.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me implement the derivative function using Qython. The derivative of a polynomial with coefficients `xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ...` is obtained by multiplying each coefficient by its power and reducing the power by 1.

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write the Qython code to the output file:

Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_62.qy`. The function correctly computes polynomial derivatives by:
1. Returning an empty list for constants or empty input
2. Using vectorized operations to multiply coefficients by their powers (1, 2, 3, ...)
3. Excluding the constant term (index 0) which has derivative 0
