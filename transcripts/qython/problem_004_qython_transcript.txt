def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: mean_absolute_deviation

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_4.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and then implement the solution.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the mean absolute deviation function:

Now let me implement and test the mean_absolute_deviation function:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Message #1) at 08:38:10 ---
  qython_code:
    def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
        mean_val = np.mean(numbers)
        deviations = np.abs(numbers - mean_val)
        return np.mean(deviations)
    
    # Test cases
    print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))
    print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]))
    print(mean_absolute_deviation([10.0]))

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Let me verify with the expected test case one more time:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Message #1) at 08:38:14 ---
  qython_code:
    def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
        mean_val = np.mean(numbers)
        deviations = np.abs(numbers - mean_val)
        return np.mean(deviations)
    
    # Verify the exact test case from the problem
    result = mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    print(String("Result:"), result)
    print(String("Expected: 1.0"))

result:mean_absolute_deviation[(1.0;2.0;3.0;4.0)];

Excellent! Now let me write the final solution to the file:

--- 14. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:38:20 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_4_qython_session_61720071/problem_solution_4.qy
  content:
    def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
        mean_val = np.mean(numbers)
        deviations = np.abs(numbers - mean_val)
        return np.mean(deviations)
    

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:38:25 ---
Done! I've implemented the `mean_absolute_deviation` function in Qython using vectorized numpy operations:

1. Calculate the mean of the input numbers
2. Compute the absolute deviations from the mean
3. Return the average of those deviations

The solution has been tested and written to `problem_solution_4.qy`.
