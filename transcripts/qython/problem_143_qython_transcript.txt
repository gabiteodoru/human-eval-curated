Problem HumanEval/143
============================================================

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = String("This is a test")
        Output: String("is")

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = String("lets go for swimming")

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: words_in_sentence

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_143.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

Now let me break down the problem:
1. Split the sentence into words
2. Check which words have prime-length
3. Return only those words joined together

Let me start by implementing a helper function to check if a number is prime:

Done! I've successfully solved HumanEval/143 using Qython. The solution:

1. **`is_prime(n)`**: Helper function that checks if a number is prime using trial division
2. **`words_in_sentence(sentence)`**: Main function that:
   - Splits the sentence into words using `.split()`
   - Filters words using a list comprehension to keep only those with prime-length
   - Joins the filtered words back with spaces using `String(" ").join()`

The solution has been tested and written to `problem_solution_143.qy`.
