Please solve this HumanEval problem using Qython.

Problem HumanEval/152
============================================================

def compare(game,guess):
    """I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: compare

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_152.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me setup the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

Now let me implement and test the solution. The problem asks to compare two arrays and return the absolute difference between each pair of elements:

  qython_code:
    
    def compare(game, guess):

        If guessed correctly, value is 0, otherwise it's the absolute difference.
        """
        return np.abs(game - guess)
    
    # Test with the examples
    result1 = compare([1,2,3,4,5,1], [1,2,3,4,2,-2])
    print(String("Test 1:"), result1)
    
    result2 = compare([0,5,0,0,0,4], [4,1,1,0,0,-2])
    print(String("Test 2:"), result2)

result2:compare[(0;5;0;0;0;4);(4;1;1;0;0;-2)];

 Test 2: List_Int64([4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]) 

None

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write the Qython code to the file:

--- 11. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 13:31:40 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_152_qython_session_73f72c28/problem_solution_152.qy
  content:
    def compare(game, guess):
        """Return array showing how far off each guess was from actual score.
        If guessed correctly, value is 0, otherwise it's the absolute difference.
        """
        return np.abs(game - guess)
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 13:31:45 ---
Done! I've implemented the solution using Qython's vectorized operations. The `compare` function uses `np.abs(game - guess)` to compute the absolute difference between each pair of elements in the two arrays, which is exactly what the problem requires.
