Please solve this HumanEval problem using Qython.

Problem HumanEval/24

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: largest_divisor

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_24.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and then implement the solution.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:50:36 ---
Now let me implement the `largest_divisor` function. The approach is to find the largest divisor by checking from n//2 down to 1:

    def largest_divisor(n):

        >>> largest_divisor(15)
        5
        """
        # Start from n//2 and go down to 1
        i = n // 2
        while i >= 1:
            if n % i == 0:
                return i
            i -= 1
        return 1
    
    # Test cases
    print(String("Test 1:"), largest_divisor(15))
    print(String("Test 2:"), largest_divisor(12))
    print(String("Test 3:"), largest_divisor(7))
    print(String("Test 4:"), largest_divisor(100))

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write the final Qython code to the file:

--- 11. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:50:42 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_24_qython_session_6e9135ea/problem_solution_24.qy
  content:
    def largest_divisor(n):
        """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
        >>> largest_divisor(15)
        5
        """
        # Start from n//2 and go down to 1
        i = n // 2
        while i >= 1:
            if n % i == 0:
                return i
            i -= 1
        return 1
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:50:46 ---
Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_24.qy`. The function finds the largest divisor by starting from n//2 (the maximum possible divisor smaller than n) and checking downward until it finds the first number that divides n evenly.
