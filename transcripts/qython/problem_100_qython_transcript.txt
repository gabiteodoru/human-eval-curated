Please solve this HumanEval problem using Qython.

Problem HumanEval/100
============================================================

def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: make_a_pile

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_100.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me setup the Qython namespace and understand the problem better:

  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:07:28 ---
Now let me analyze the problem and implement the solution:

The problem asks to:
1. Create a pile of n levels
2. First level has n stones
3. If n is odd, next levels have next odd numbers (n, n+2, n+4, ...)
4. If n is even, next levels have next even numbers (n, n+2, n+4, ...)

This can be vectorized using numpy operations. Let me implement and test:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Message #1) at 10:07:31 ---
  qython_code:
    def make_a_pile(n):
        # Generate array [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]
        indices = np.arange(n)
        # Each level adds 2 to the previous: n, n+2, n+4, ...
        result = n + 2 * indices
        return result
    
    # Test cases
    print(make_a_pile(3))
    print(make_a_pile(4))
    print(make_a_pile(5))

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Let me verify with the example from the problem:

--- 11. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Message #1) at 10:07:35 ---
  qython_code:
    # Verify the example from the problem
    result = make_a_pile(3)
    expected = [3, 5, 7]
    print(String("Result:"), result)
    print(String("Expected:"), expected)
    print(String("Match:"), result is expected)

.qython.print["\"Match:\"";"result~expected"]

EXECUTION RESULT:
Result: List_Int64([3, 5, 7]) 
 Expected: List_Int64([3, 5, 7]) 
 Match: True 

None

--- 13. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:07:38 ---
Excellent! The solution is working correctly. Now let me write the Qython code to the file:

--- 14. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 10:07:40 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_100_qython_session_32ccb9d8/problem_solution_100.qy
  content:
    def make_a_pile(n):
        indices = np.arange(n)
        result = n + 2 * indices
        return result
    

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 10:07:45 ---
Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_100.qy`. 

The solution uses a vectorized approach:
- Creates an array of indices `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` using `np.arange(n)`
- Computes `n + 2 * indices` to get the sequence of stones for each level
- Works for both odd and even n, since we always add 2 to get the next number (odd→odd, even→even)
