QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: solution

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_121.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

Now let me implement and test the solution. The problem asks for the sum of odd elements at even positions:

Perfect! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Now let me write the Qython code to a file:

--- 11. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 13:01:33 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_121_qython_session_7d638f75/problem_solution_121.qy
  content:
    def solution(lst):
        """Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions."""
        # Get elements at even positions (0, 2, 4, ...)
        even_positions = lst[::2]
    
        # Filter for odd elements
        odd_mask = (even_positions % 2) != 0
        odd_at_even_pos = even_positions[where(odd_mask)]
    
        # Return sum
        return np.sum(odd_at_even_pos)
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 13:01:38 ---
Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_121.qy`. The solution:

1. Uses slicing `lst[::2]` to get elements at even positions (indices 0, 2, 4, ...)
2. Applies modulo operation to find odd elements (where `% 2 != 0`)
3. Uses `where()` for boolean indexing to filter odd elements
4. Returns the sum using `np.sum()`

All test cases pass:
- `[5, 8, 7, 1]` → 12 (5 + 7)
- `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` → 9 (3 + 3 + 3)
- `[30, 13, 24, 321]` → 0 (no odd elements at even positions)
