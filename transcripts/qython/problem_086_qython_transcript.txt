Problem HumanEval/86

def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle(String('Hi')) returns String('Hi')
    anti_shuffle(String('hello')) returns String('ehllo')
    anti_shuffle(String('Hello World!!!')) returns String('Hello !!!Wdlor')

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: anti_shuffle

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_86.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and work on the solution:

  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:49:56 ---
Now let me understand the problem and implement the solution step by step:

The problem requires:
1. Split the string by spaces
2. For each word, sort its characters in ascending order by ASCII value
3. Keep the order of words and spaces

Let me test a helper function to sort characters in a word:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Message #1) at 09:49:58 ---
  qython_code:
    def sort_word_chars(word):
        """Sort characters in a word by ASCII value"""
        chars = [c for c in word]
        sorted_chars = sorted(chars, key=lambda c: ord(c))
        return String("").join(sorted_chars)
    
    # Test
    print(sort_word_chars(String("hello")))
    print(sort_word_chars(String("Hi")))
    print(sort_word_chars(String("World!!!")))

--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:50:01 ---
I need to use `sorted()` without the `key` parameter. Let me check the Qython documentation more carefully and use a different approach:

    def sort_word_chars(word):

        chars = [c for c in word]
        # Get ASCII values
        ascii_vals = [ord(c) for c in chars]
        # Get sorted indices
        sorted_indices = np.argsort(ascii_vals)
        # Reorder chars
        sorted_chars = [chars[i] for i in sorted_indices]
        return String("").join(sorted_chars)
    
    # Test
    print(sort_word_chars(String("hello")))
    print(sort_word_chars(String("Hi")))
    print(sort_word_chars(String("World!!!")))

--- 18. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:50:20 ---
Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_86.qy`. The solution:

1. Defines a helper function `sort_word_chars()` that sorts characters in a word by ASCII value using `np.argsort()`
2. Splits the input string by spaces
3. Applies the character sorting to each word
4. Joins the sorted words back with spaces

The solution correctly handles all test cases including maintaining word order and preserving blank spaces.
