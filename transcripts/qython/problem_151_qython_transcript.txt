QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: double_the_difference

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_151.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

Done! The solution is complete and written to `problem_solution_151.qy`. 

The implementation:
- Uses a while loop to iterate through the list
- Checks each element for three conditions: positive (x > 0), integer (x == np.floor(x)), and odd (x % 2 == 1)
- Sums the squares of valid numbers
- Returns 0 for empty lists or when no valid numbers exist

All test cases pass correctly.
