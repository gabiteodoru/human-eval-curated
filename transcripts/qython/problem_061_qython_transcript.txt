QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: correct_bracketing

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_61.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:33:42 ---
Now let me implement and test the solution. The problem is to check if brackets are correctly balanced. I'll use a vectorized approach with numpy operations:

  qython_code:
    def correct_bracketing(brackets):
        # Convert to list of characters for processing
        chars = [c for c in brackets]
        
        # Map opening bracket to 1, closing bracket to -1
        values = [1 if c is Char("(") else -1 for c in chars]
        
        # Calculate cumulative sum - this tracks balance
        cumsum = np.cumsum(values)
        
        # Check two conditions:
        # 1. Final sum must be 0 (equal opens and closes)
        # 2. cumsum must never go negative (no closing before opening)
        return cumsum[-1] == 0 and np.min(cumsum) >= 0
    
    # Test cases
    print(correct_bracketing(String("(")))
    print(correct_bracketing(String("()")))
    print(correct_bracketing(String("(()())")))

Perfect! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Now let me write the final Qython code to the output file:

        values = [1 if c is Char("(") else -1 for c in chars]
    
        # Calculate cumulative sum - this tracks balance
        cumsum = np.cumsum(values)
    
        # Check two conditions:
        # 1. Final sum must be 0 (equal opens and closes)
        # 2. cumsum must never go negative (no closing before opening)
        return cumsum[-1] == 0 and np.min(cumsum) >= 0
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:34:01 ---
Solution complete! The Qython implementation uses a vectorized approach:

1. Converts brackets to character list
2. Maps `(` to `1` and `)` to `-1`
3. Uses `np.cumsum()` to track running balance
4. Checks that final sum is 0 (balanced) and no intermediate value goes negative (proper nesting)

The solution is written to `problem_solution_61.qy`.
