Please solve this HumanEval problem using Qython.

Problem HumanEval/23
============================================================

def strlen(string):
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen(String(''))
    0
    >>> strlen(String('abc'))
    3
    """

============================================================

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: strlen

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_23.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

  host:

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

--- 6. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__setup_qython_namespace (Message #1) at 08:50:01 ---
  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:50:06 ---
Now let me implement and test the `strlen` function. This is straightforward - I just need to return the length of a String:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Message #1) at 08:50:07 ---
  qython_code:
    def strlen(text):
        """ Return length of given string """
        return len(text)
    
    # Test cases
    print(String("Test 1:"), strlen(String('')))
    print(String("Test 2:"), strlen(String('abc')))

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Event #8) at 08:50:07 ---
TRANSLATION:
strlen:{[text]
    " Return length of given string ";
    :count[text]
    };
/ Test cases
.qython.print["\"Test 1:\"";"strlen[\"\"]"];
.qython.print["\"Test 2:\"";"strlen[\"abc\"]"]

EXECUTION RESULT:
Test 1: 0 
 Test 2: 3 

None

--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:50:11 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write the Qython code to the file:

--- 11. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:50:12 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_23_qython_session_14733093/problem_solution_23.qy
  content:
    def strlen(text):
        """ Return length of given string """
        return len(text)
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:50:14 ---
Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_23.qy`. The function simply uses `len()` to return the length of the given String, which works for both empty strings and strings with characters.
