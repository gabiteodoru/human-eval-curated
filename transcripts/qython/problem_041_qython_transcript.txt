Please solve this HumanEval problem using Qython.

Problem HumanEval/41
============================================================

def car_race_collision(n):
    """
    Imagine a road that'
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car thatString('s moving left to right hits a car that')s moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: car_race_collision

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_41.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by understanding the problem and then implement a solution.

Now let me connect to the q server and understand the problem better:

Now let me analyze the problem:

The problem is asking: if n cars are moving left-to-right and n cars are moving right-to-left, how many collisions occur?

Since each car moving left-to-right will collide with each car moving right-to-left, and there are n cars in each direction, the answer is simply n * n = n².

Let me implement and test this solution:

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write the Qython code to the output file:

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:18:37 ---
Done! The solution is written to `problem_solution_41.qy`. 

The key insight is that each of the n cars moving left-to-right will collide with each of the n cars moving right-to-left, resulting in n² total collisions.
