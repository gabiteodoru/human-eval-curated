QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: is_equal_to_sum_even

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_138.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me understand the problem:
- We need to check if a number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
- The minimum positive even number is 2
- So the minimum sum of 4 positive even numbers is 2+2+2+2 = 8
- Any number >= 8 and even can be written as such a sum
- Numbers < 8 or odd numbers cannot

Let me implement and test this:

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 10. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 13:16:23 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_138_qython_session_b1b523f4/problem_solution_138.qy
  content:
    def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
        """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers"""
        return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0
    

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 13:16:27 ---
Done! The solution is implemented in `problem_solution_138.qy`. 

The logic is straightforward:
- The minimum sum of 4 positive even numbers is 2+2+2+2 = 8
- Any even number â‰¥ 8 can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers (e.g., 2+2+2+(n-6))
- Therefore, we check if `n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0`
