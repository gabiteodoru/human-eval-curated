QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: factorize

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_25.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

Now let me implement and test the factorize function. The problem is to return a list of prime factors in ascending order, with repetitions.

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write the Qython code to a file.

Done! I've successfully:

1. Connected to the q server on localhost:5001
2. Implemented the `factorize` function in Qython using a classic trial division algorithm
3. Tested it with all three test cases (8→[2,2,2], 25→[5,5], 70→[2,5,7])
4. Written the working solution to `problem_solution_25.qy`

The solution iteratively divides the number by increasing divisors (starting from 2), collecting each prime factor the appropriate number of times, and handles any remaining prime factor greater than 1 at the end.
