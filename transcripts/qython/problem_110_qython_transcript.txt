Problem HumanEval/110
============================================================

def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return String("YES").
    Otherwise, return String("NO").
    For example:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => String("YES")
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => String("NO")

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: exchange

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_110.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using Qython.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem:

Now let me understand the problem and implement a solution:

The problem asks to determine if we can exchange elements between two lists to make lst1 contain only even numbers. The key insight is:
- We need enough even numbers total (from both lists combined) to fill lst1
- We can exchange any number of elements

Let me implement and test this:

  (no parameters)

  qython_code:
    
    def exchange(lst1, lst2):
        # Count total even numbers in both lists
        evens_in_lst1 = np.sum(lst1 % 2 == 0)
        evens_in_lst2 = np.sum(lst2 % 2 == 0)
        total_evens = evens_in_lst1 + evens_in_lst2
        
        # We need at least len(lst1) even numbers to fill lst1
        needed = len(lst1)
        
        if total_evens >= needed:
            return String("YES")
        else:
            return String("NO")
    
    # Test cases
    print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]))
    print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]))

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Let me verify with a few more test cases to ensure it's robust:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Message #1) at 12:52:16 ---
  qython_code:
    
    # Additional test cases
    # All odd in lst1, enough evens in lst2
    print(exchange([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6, 8]))
    
    # All even in lst1 already
    print(exchange([2, 4, 6], [1, 3, 5]))
    
    # Edge case: single elements
    print(exchange([1], [2]))
    print(exchange([1], [3]))
    
    # Mixed case
    print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [2, 4, 6]))

Excellent! All test cases pass. Now let me write the final solution to the file:

--- 14. Text Block (Message #1) at 12:52:28 ---
Solution complete! The Qython implementation uses vectorized numpy operations to:
1. Count even numbers in both lists using `np.sum(lst % 2 == 0)`
2. Check if the total even numbers available is at least the length of lst1
3. Return String("YES") or String("NO") accordingly
