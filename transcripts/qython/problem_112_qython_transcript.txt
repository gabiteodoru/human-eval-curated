Please solve this HumanEval problem using Qython.

Problem HumanEval/112
============================================================

def reverse_delete(s,c):
    """Task
    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    then check if the result string is palindrome.
    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
    Example
    For s = String("abcde"), c = String("ae"), the result should be (String('bcd'),False)
    For s = String("abcdef"), c = String("b")  the result should be (String('acdef'),False)
    For s = String("abcdedcba"), c = String("ab"), the result should be (String('cdedc'),True)

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: reverse_delete

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_112.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 12:53:44 ---
Let me break down the problem:
1. Delete all characters in `s` that are in `c`
2. Check if the result is a palindrome
3. Return a tuple with (result_string, is_palindrome)

Let me implement and test this step by step:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Message #1) at 12:53:45 ---
  qython_code:
    
    # Test basic string filtering - remove characters that are in c
    def reverse_delete(s, c):
        # Filter out characters that are in c
        result = String("").join([char for char in s if char not in c])
        
        # Check if palindrome
        is_palindrome = result is reverse(result)
        
        return (result, is_palindrome)
    
    # Test with the examples
    print(reverse_delete(String("abcde"), String("ae")))
    print(reverse_delete(String("abcdef"), String("b")))
    print(reverse_delete(String("abcdedcba"), String("ab")))

TRANSLATION:
/ Test basic string filtering - remove characters that are in c
reverse_delete:{[s;c]
    result:.qython.join[""; {[char] char} each s where {[c;char] not char qin c}[c] each s];
    is_palindrome:result~reverse[result];
    :(result;is_palindrome)
    };
/ Test with the examples
.qython.print["reverse_delete[\"abcde\";\"ae\"]"];
.qython.print["reverse_delete[\"abcdef\";enlist[\"b\"]]"];
.qython.print["reverse_delete[\"abcdedcba\";\"ab\"]"]

EXECUTION RESULT:
List_Untyped([String("bcd"), False]) 
 List_Untyped([String("acdef"), False]) 
 List_Untyped([String("cdedc"), True]) 

None

--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 12:53:49 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Now let me write the final Qython code to the file:

--- 11. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 12:53:51 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_112_qython_session_0035b99c/problem_solution_112.qy
  content:
    def reverse_delete(s, c):
        # Filter out characters that are in c
        result = String("").join([char for char in s if char not in c])
    
        # Check if palindrome
        is_palindrome = result is reverse(result)
    
        return (result, is_palindrome)
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 12:53:56 ---
Done. The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_112.qy`. 

The solution:
- Uses list comprehension to filter out characters from `s` that appear in `c`
- Joins the filtered characters with `String("").join()`
- Checks palindrome using `is` operator (whole-string equality) with `reverse()`
- Returns tuple with (result_string, is_palindrome)
