Please solve this HumanEval problem using Qython.

Problem HumanEval/139
============================================================

def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: special_factorial

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_139.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me understand the problem and implement the solution:

The special/Brazilian factorial is:
- special_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
- For example: special_factorial(4) = 4! * 3! * 2! * 1! = 24 * 6 * 2 * 1 = 288

Let me implement and test this:

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Let me verify with the expected output (special_factorial(4) = 288 ✓) and write the solution to the file:

            i += 1

            i += 1

Solution complete! The Qython implementation:

- `factorial(n)`: Helper function that calculates standard factorial
- `special_factorial(n)`: Multiplies factorials from 1! to n! 
- Verified with special_factorial(4) = 288 ✓

The solution is saved to `problem_solution_139.qy`.
