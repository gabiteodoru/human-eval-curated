QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: correct_bracketing

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_56.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll help you solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:30:59 ---
Now let me understand the problem and implement a solution. The problem is to check if a string of '<' and '>' brackets is correctly balanced. I need to use vectorized operations where possible.

The approach:
- Convert '<' to +1 and '>' to -1
- Use cumulative sum to track the depth
- Check that depth never goes negative (no closing before opening)
- Check that final depth is 0 (all brackets are matched)

Let me test this approach:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Message #1) at 09:31:02 ---
  qython_code:
    def correct_bracketing(brackets):
        # Convert brackets to array of +1 and -1
        values = [1 if char is Char("<") else -1 for char in brackets]
        
        # Calculate cumulative sum to track depth
        depth = np.cumsum(values)
        
        # Check if depth ever goes negative (closing before opening)
        # and if final depth is 0 (all brackets matched)
        return (np.min(depth) >= 0) and (depth[-1] == 0)
    
    # Test cases
    print(correct_bracketing(String("<")))
    print(correct_bracketing(String("<>")))
    print(correct_bracketing(String("<<><>>")))
    print(correct_bracketing(String("><<>")))

Perfect! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Now let me write the Qython code to the file:

--- 11. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 09:31:08 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_56_qython_session_1a348ac7/problem_solution_56.qy
  content:
    def correct_bracketing(brackets):
        # Convert brackets to array of +1 and -1
        values = [1 if char is Char("<") else -1 for char in brackets]
    
        # Calculate cumulative sum to track depth
        depth = np.cumsum(values)
    
        # Check if depth ever goes negative (closing before opening)
        # and if final depth is 0 (all brackets matched)
        return (np.min(depth) >= 0) and (depth[-1] == 0)
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:31:11 ---
Done. The solution uses vectorized operations to:
1. Convert each '<' to +1 and '>' to -1
2. Calculate cumulative sum to track bracket depth
3. Verify depth never goes negative and ends at 0
