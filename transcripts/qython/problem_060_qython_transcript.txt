QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: sum_to_n

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_60.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and then implement the solution.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:33:13 ---
Now let me implement and test the `sum_to_n` function. This is a simple mathematical problem - summing numbers from 1 to n. The most efficient approach in Qython is to use the formula n*(n+1)/2 or use numpy's sum with arange.

    # Test cases
    print(sum_to_n(30))
    print(sum_to_n(100))

Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 11. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 09:33:21 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_60_qython_session_ccb4a69a/problem_solution_60.qy
  content:
    def sum_to_n(n):
        """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n."""
        return int(n * (n + 1) / 2)
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:33:24 ---
Done! The solution uses the mathematical formula for summing integers from 1 to n: n√ó(n+1)/2. All test cases pass correctly.
