    In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains 
    apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of 
    the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits 
    in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
    for examble:

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: fruit_distribution

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_67.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

Now let me implement and test the solution. The problem is to parse a string containing numbers of apples and oranges, extract those numbers, and subtract them from the total to get the number of mangos.

I need to use a different approach since `.isdigit()` is not available. Let me try parsing the numbers differently:

Right, Qython doesn't support `for` loops. Let me use a different approach with regex or parsing:

Perfect! The solution works. Now let me write the clean Qython code to the file without the test code:

        # Filter out zeros and sum

        return result
    

--- 21. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:37:53 ---
Done. The solution:
- Uses a helper function `extract_number` to check if a word contains only digits using `.within()` 
- Splits the input string and extracts all numbers
- Subtracts the sum of extracted numbers from the total to get mangos
- All test cases pass (8, 2, 95, 19)
