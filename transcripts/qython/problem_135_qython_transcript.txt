def can_arrange(arr):
    """Create a function which Return the largest index i where arr[i] < arr[i-1], or -1 if no such index exists.

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: can_arrange

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_135.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me understand the problem and implement a solution:

The problem asks to find the largest index `i` where `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, or return -1 if no such index exists.

Let me implement and test this step by step:

            return -1
        
        # Create boolean array where arr[i] < arr[i-1]
        # Compare arr[1:] with arr[:-1]
        comparisons = arr[1:] < arr[:len(arr)-1]

        indices = where(comparisons)

        if len(indices) == 0:
            return -1
        
        # Return the largest index (add 1 because we compared starting from index 1)
        return int(indices[-1] + 1)
    
    # Test with examples
    print(can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]))  # Expected: 3
    print(can_arrange([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected: -1

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Let me test a few more edge cases to make sure:

--- 10. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Message #1) at 13:14:22 ---
  qython_code:
    # Additional tests
    print(can_arrange([]))  # Empty array
    print(can_arrange([5]))  # Single element
    print(can_arrange([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]))  # All descending
    print(can_arrange([1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]))  # Multiple violations, should return largest (4)

Excellent! All test cases pass. Now let me write the final solution to the file:

        # If no such index exists, return -1
        if len(indices) == 0:

        # Return the largest index (add 1 because we compared starting from index 1)
        return int(indices[-1] + 1)
    

--- 14. Text Block (Message #1) at 13:14:32 ---
Solution completed! The Qython implementation:

1. Handles edge cases (empty or single-element arrays)
2. Uses vectorized numpy-style operations to compare `arr[1:]` with `arr[:-1]`
3. Uses `where()` to find indices where the condition is true
4. Returns the largest such index (adjusted by +1 since comparison starts at index 1)

Tested successfully with all examples including edge cases.
