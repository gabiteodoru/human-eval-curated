QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: incr_list

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_42.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and then implement the solution.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:18:54 ---
Now let me implement and test the solution. This is a simple problem - I need to increment each element in a list by 1. In Qython, I can use vectorized operations:

--- 8. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Message #1) at 09:18:56 ---
  qython_code:
    def incr_list(lst):
        """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
        return lst + 1
    
    # Test cases
    print(incr_list([1, 2, 3]))
    print(incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))

--- 9. Tool Result for mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython (Event #8) at 09:18:56 ---
TRANSLATION:
incr_list:{[lst]
    "Return list with elements incremented by 1.";
    :lst+1
    };
/ Test cases
.qython.print["incr_list[(1;2;3)]"];
.qython.print["incr_list[(5;3;5;2;3;3;9;0;123)]"]

EXECUTION RESULT:
List_Int64([2, 3, 4]) 
 List_Int64([6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]) 

None

--- 10. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:19:00 ---
Perfect! The solution works correctly. The vectorized operation `lst + 1` increments all elements in the list by 1, which is exactly what we need.

Now let me write the final solution to the file:

--- 11. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 09:19:02 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_42_qython_session_44231c6c/problem_solution_42.qy
  content:
    def incr_list(lst):
        """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
        return lst + 1
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:19:05 ---
Done! The solution uses Qython's vectorized array operations to increment all elements by 1 in a single operation, which is efficient and concise.
