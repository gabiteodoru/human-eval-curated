Please solve this HumanEval problem using Qython.

Problem HumanEval/157
============================================================

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: right_angle_triangle

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_157.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and then implement the solution.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 14:37:40 ---
Now let me implement and test the solution. A right-angled triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse (longest side). I need to check all three permutations since we don't know which side is the hypotenuse.

  qython_code:
    def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
        # Check all three permutations of Pythagorean theorem
        # since we don't know which side is the hypotenuse
        return (a*a + b*b == c*c) or (a*a + c*c == b*b) or (b*b + c*c == a*a)
    
    # Test cases
    print(right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5))  # True
    print(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3))  # False
    print(right_angle_triangle(5, 3, 4))  # True (different order)
    print(right_angle_triangle(5, 12, 13))  # True
    print(right_angle_triangle(1, 1, 1))  # False

Perfect! The solution works correctly. Now let me write it to the file:

--- 11. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 14:37:50 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_157_qython_session_f351778c/problem_solution_157.qy
  content:
    def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
        # Check all three permutations of Pythagorean theorem
        # since we don't know which side is the hypotenuse
        return (a*a + b*b == c*c) or (a*a + c*c == b*b) or (b*b + c*c == a*a)
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 14:37:54 ---
Done! The Qython solution for HumanEval/157 has been implemented and saved to `problem_solution_157.qy`. The function checks if three sides form a right-angled triangle by testing all three permutations of the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²), since we don't know which side is the hypotenuse.
