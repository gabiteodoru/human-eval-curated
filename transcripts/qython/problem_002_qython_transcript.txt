QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: truncate_number

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_2.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me setup the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:37:03 ---
Now let me implement and test the `truncate_number` function. The task is simple: given a positive floating point number, return the decimal part (the number minus its integer part).

I see the issue - the `int()` function in Qython is giving negative results for the decimal parts. Let me check what's happening and use `np.floor()` instead:

Perfect! The solution works correctly. The small floating-point precision issue with 10.7 is expected in floating-point arithmetic. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 14. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 08:37:15 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_2_qython_session_1b230482/problem_solution_2.qy
  content:
    def truncate_number(number):
        """Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
        and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
        (leftover part always smaller than 1).
    
        Return the decimal part of the number.
        """
        return number - np.floor(number)
    

--- 15. Text Block (Message #1) at 08:37:18 ---
Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_2.qy`. The function uses `np.floor()` to get the integer part and subtracts it from the original number to return the decimal part.
