QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: monotonic

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_57.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

Now let me implement and test the solution. The problem asks to check if a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. I'll use vectorized numpy operations:

        # Check if monotonically increasing

        is_increasing = np.all(diffs >= 0)
        
        # Check if monotonically decreasing

Perfect! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Let me write the Qython code to the file:

--- 11. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 09:31:38 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_57_qython_session_1e17e446/problem_solution_57.qy
  content:
    def monotonic(l):
        """Return True is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing."""
        if len(l) <= 1:
            return True
    
        # Check if monotonically increasing
        diffs = np.diff(l)
        is_increasing = np.all(diffs >= 0)
    
        # Check if monotonically decreasing
        is_decreasing = np.all(diffs <= 0)
    
        return is_increasing or is_decreasing
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:31:40 ---
Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_57.qy`. The implementation:

1. Handles edge cases (lists with 0 or 1 element are monotonic)
2. Uses `np.diff()` to compute differences between consecutive elements
3. Checks if all differences are non-negative (increasing) or non-positive (decreasing)
4. Returns `True` if either condition holds

The solution is vectorized and passes all test cases.
