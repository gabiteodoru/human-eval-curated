QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: sum_squares

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_133.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

Now let me setup the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 13:13:05 ---
Now let me implement and test the solution. The problem asks to:
1. Round each element up to the nearest integer (ceiling)
2. Square each element
3. Sum the squared values

Let me implement and test this:

        # Square each element

Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 11. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 13:13:15 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_133_qython_session_61d0535e/problem_solution_133.qy
  content:
    def sum_squares(lst):
        """Sum of squared numbers, rounding each element up first (ceiling)."""
        ceiled = np.ceil(lst)
        squared = ceiled * ceiled
        return np.sum(squared)
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 13:13:19 ---
Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_133.qy`. The implementation:
- Uses `np.ceil()` to round each element up (ceiling)
- Squares each element with element-wise multiplication
- Returns the sum using `np.sum()`

All test cases pass correctly.
