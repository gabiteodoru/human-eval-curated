Please solve this HumanEval problem using Qython.

Problem HumanEval/134
============================================================

def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    '''
    Create a function that returns True if the last character
    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
    a part of a word, and False otherwise.
    Note: String("word") is a group of characters separated by space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(String("apple pie")) ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(String("apple pi e")) ➞ True
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(String("apple pi e ")) ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(String("")) ➞ False 
    '''

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: check_if_last_char_is_a_letter

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_134.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and implement the solution:

--- 6. Tool Call: mcp__qmcp__setup_qython_namespace (Message #1) at 13:13:32 ---
  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 13:13:38 ---
Now let me implement and test the solution. The problem asks to check if:
1. The last character is alphabetical
2. The last character is NOT part of a word (i.e., it's isolated by spaces)

Let me break this down:
- Empty string → False
- Last char is space → False
- Last char is alphabetical AND (it's the only char OR preceded by a space) → True
- Otherwise → False

Perfect! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Let me write the Qython code to a file:

--- 11. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 13:13:49 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_134_qython_session_abb81aa3/problem_solution_134.qy
  content:
    def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
        # Empty string case
        if len(txt) == 0:
            return False
    
        # Get last character
        last_char = txt[len(txt) - 1]
    
        # Check if last character is alphabetical
        is_alpha = (last_char >= Char('a') and last_char <= Char('z')) or (last_char >= Char('A') and last_char <= Char('Z'))
    
        if not is_alpha:
            return False
    
        # If only one character, it's not part of a word (it IS the word, but problem says "not part of a word")
        # Based on examples, single letter should return True (it's isolated)
        if len(txt) == 1:
            return True
    
        # Check if preceded by space (not part of a word)
        prev_char = txt[len(txt) - 2]
        return prev_char is Char(' ')
    

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 13:13:53 ---
Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_134.qy`. The function correctly:

1. Returns `False` for empty strings
2. Returns `False` if the last character is not alphabetical
3. Returns `True` if the last character is alphabetical and either stands alone or is preceded by a space (not part of a word)
4. Returns `False` if the last character is part of a word or is a space
