QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: will_it_fly

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_72.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll help you solve this HumanEval problem using Qython. Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem.

Now let me analyze the problem. Based on the examples, I can see that:
- `will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)` → False (sum is 3 ≤ 5, but not palindrome)
- `will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)` → False (is palindrome, but sum is 8 > 1)
- `will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)` → True (sum is 8 ≤ 9 and is palindrome)
- `will_it_fly([3], 5)` → True (sum is 3 ≤ 5 and is palindrome)

The function should return True if:
1. The list is a palindrome
2. The sum of elements ≤ w

Let me implement and test this:

  qython_code:
    def will_it_fly(q, w):
        # Check if palindrome using 'is' for whole-array comparison
        is_palindrome = q is reverse(q)
        # Check if sum is within weight limit
        total_weight = np.sum(q)
        return is_palindrome and (total_weight <= w)
    
    # Test cases
    print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # False - not palindrome
    print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1))  # False - palindrome but sum > 1
    print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # True - palindrome and sum <= 9
    print(will_it_fly([3], 5))  # True - palindrome and sum <= 5

TRANSLATION:
will_it_fly:{[q;w]
    is_palindrome:q~reverse[q];
    total_weight:sum[q];
    :is_palindrome and total_weight <= w
    };
/ Test cases
.qython.print["will_it_fly[(1;2);5]"] ; / False - not palindrome
.qython.print["will_it_fly[(3;2;3);1]"] ; / False - palindrome but sum > 1
.qython.print["will_it_fly[(3;2;3);9]"] ; / True - palindrome and sum <= 9
.qython.print["will_it_fly[(enlist 3);5]"]  / True - palindrome and sum <= 5

EXECUTION RESULT:
False 
 False 
 True 
 True 

None

Perfect! All test cases pass. Now let me write the solution to the file:

--- 10. Tool Call: Write (Message #1) at 09:40:34 ---
  file_path:
    /mnt/d/python/qhumaneval/problem_72_qython_session_cf0748ba/problem_solution_72.qy
  content:
    def will_it_fly(q, w):
        is_palindrome = q is reverse(q)
        total_weight = np.sum(q)
        return is_palindrome and (total_weight <= w)
    

--- 11. Text Block (Message #1) at 09:40:39 ---
Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_72.qy`. 

The solution checks two conditions:
1. The list is a palindrome (using `is` for whole-array comparison)
2. The sum of elements is less than or equal to the weight limit `w`

Both conditions must be true for the object to fly.
