Problem HumanEval/128

def prod_signs(arr):
    """
    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
    Note: return None for empty arr.

    Example:

============================================================

QYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- PREFER VECTORIZED NUMPY OPERATIONS over loops whenever possible
- Examples: np.sum(), np.min(), np.max(), np.where(), np.all(), np.any()
- Array operations: element-wise comparisons, broadcasting, boolean indexing
- If problem involves string manipulation, use mutable Strings and Chars
- When testing, use String() constructor for string inputs
- You are allowed to change parameter names (avoid reserved words)
- Since you have access to running Qython, break down code into individual
  functions and test them separately to debug issues
- Connect to q server: mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q with host localhost:5001
- Use Qython tools: mcp__qmcp__translate_and_run_qython for testing
- Check help: mcp__qmcp__qython_help for reference (especially Common Gotchas)
============================================================

Function name: prod_signs

Please:
1. Connect to the q server on localhost:5001 using mcp__qmcp__connect_to_q
2. Use the Qython tools to implement and test your solution
3. Once you have a working Qython solution, write the Qython code to a file named "problem_solution_128.qy". The file should contain the Qython main function definition and any helper functions it needs to run. Avoid adding prints, asserts, or other testing code to the output script.

Your solution should be complete and ready to run in a Qython environment.

I'll solve this HumanEval problem step by step using Qython.

Let me start by connecting to the q server and understanding the problem better.

Now let me set up the Qython namespace and understand the problem:

  (no parameters)

--- 7. Text Block (Message #1) at 13:07:07 ---
Now let me implement and test the solution. The problem requires:
1. Return None for empty array
2. Calculate sum of magnitudes (absolute values)
3. Multiply by product of all signs (1, -1, or 0)

Perfect! The solution works correctly for all test cases. Now let me write the final Qython code to the file:

--- 12. Text Block (Message #1) at 13:07:24 ---
Done! The Qython solution has been written to `problem_solution_128.qy`. The implementation uses vectorized NumPy operations to:
1. Return None for empty arrays
2. Return 0 if any element is 0
3. Calculate the sum of absolute values and multiply by the product of signs
